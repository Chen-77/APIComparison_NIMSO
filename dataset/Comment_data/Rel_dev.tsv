Once it is flagged, encryption is automatic when you save with the current id file, and decryption is automatic when you open with it.  Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption. (The reason being that a signature does not give the agent access to fhe id file conttainging the key pair.)"	Thank you very much for these answers.

DELETE i.e. only states that certain response codes should be returned if the operation actually removed something but not what should happen if i.e. the resource was not available at all. Here it is more or less individual preference. All a client wants is that a certain URI shouldn't return a resource's state after the invocation.

The ,IThing, convention is more of a C#/.Net thing."	Based on the feedback here I have decided to use constructor injection and to remove the default constructor as the parent of a component can never change by design (immutable heritage).  There is a single interface type that is permitted to have an empty parent and all methods that call getParent() are aware that the top node will return null.  If any other type of class provides null in the constructor then I throw an IllegalArgumentException so that it will fail fast.
