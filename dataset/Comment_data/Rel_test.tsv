Deinum said, nor via load-time weaving, which is the usual way Spring users apply AspectJ and is described well in the Spring manual. So with LTW you can keep your original class files (even though I would argue that the AspectJ compiler does not ""obfuscate"" them) and have the full power of AspectJ."	AspectJ when used with Spring still uses the same Spring AOP infrastructure. AspectJ is applied the same as regular aopalliance interceptors. It will only change if you yourself configure compile-timeweaving OR loadtimeweaving.

Needing to visually verify that the compilation of expectedly non-compilable code doesn't work doesn't seem to be in the spirit of unit testing, which should be able to run with the click of a button or a quick keyboard shortcut.

Since it has different dimensions, it would probably be easiest to just make separate Models for the cubes above and below the floor. Then submit the three models in order from far to near. But if your floor is opaque, then you just need to draw it before you draw the transparent stuff. The trouble with transparent stuff is that you can never rely on depth testing...you have to draw all of it from far to near. Can't go back and insert something in the middle.

0	9160	25271	Query on REST URI design [closed]	This is likely to be closed as opinion-based, but for my two cents: you're right. The URI should not contain information that is only used for debugging purposes. Use a (custom) header for that. Although I have seen projects that used the standard ,User-Agent, header for this.	To add on to what @rickdenhaan mentioned, URIs are just pointers to resources and should not be used to extract knowledge. The reasoning behind that is that servers are free to change the URI structure anytime it wants to and clients that perform some knowledge extraction will break as a consequence. And the aim of REST is that clients are decoupled from services to allow servers to evolve freely in future. A core premise of REST is that clients are taught everything they need to know from servers anyway, as such URIs are just references to resources and nothing more		0.6095602	0.39043972

1	837	4848	GetAsyncKeyState and VirtualKeys/special characters using JNA (JAVA)	I think the problem is the use of GetKeyboardState: from MSDN, sounds like it's essentially equivalent to calling GetKeyState, whereas you want the equivalent for GetAsyncKeyState, since another thread has current input focus. Perhaps try populating keystate manually with GetAsyncKeyState, or using AttachInput?	My point is that ToUnicode should work out this shift information for you: but it needs accurate keyboard state information to work - it likely pulls the modifier information from that keyboard table, but since it's being fetched with GetKeyboardState, it does not necessarily reflect actual modifier state, which may be why it's returning unshifted characters. You might want to check if any of the keys corresponding to modifiers are pressed in the keystate array when you expect them to be.	1.0	0.44931707	0.5506829000000001

SDK.CompanyNameLibrary.CompanyInternalAPI tells the implementer that they are getting the company's internal API for whatever library they are using. Although I would probably drop the SDK as it isn't really necessary.	So put everything into one namespace, and simply make things internal / public?  That means I'm going to have ~hundred classes all in one folder in the project, only maybe 25-30 of which are going to be marked public.  Is that really a good practice?

That's comparing CPU time to Memory usage.  When memory is constrained, wasted memory is wasted memory.  On non-pipelined/primitively pipelined processors, you can do an awful lot of calculating in the time it takes to deal with the memory bus.  Also the performance cost of the wasted memory in GC pauses is at an unpredictable time, not a slower response to the specific user operation.  I have no data and no way to generate any, but it would not surprise me at all if on a common 1996 jvm+desktop computer the Calendar object allocation+gc actually is comparable to the calculation cost.		0.59859616	0.40140387

Shortcut methods may be a good idea somewhere, but the API design like this is really confusing.		0.5705585999999999	0.42944136

Since each Polygon is a solid object, my path would not be able to travel through it and only checking the borders would result in a false positive.

I'm actually considering this solution at the moment as it seems to make sense in my head. I'm just imagining how this scenario plays out with a large amount of shapes. It seems like with each move from vertex to vertex, which is what my program will be doing, I would have to check every combination of points within each shape to see if it intersects with my path.

Yes.  In my experience it is best to not only have 5 different classes for 5 different versions but, sometimes, it is even good to have completely separate projects for them.  The risk you run of having them all in the same project is that you might accidentally change something on a previous version without meaning to because of something you needed to add for a current version.

"Every event (SomeEvent and EventType) has its action so the API can determine to which event-type to send the "",SomeEvent,"". Well then thanks, that was much simpler than I thought :)"	Just be careful about over-engineering this.  Clients use your library; events happen; there are data associated with those events.  All you need to do is define an interface that passes the client that event data and let them define the implementation they need.  Then allow the client to register for the event.  In that sense, @CodeLionX 's answer is a little more accurate for your situation.  IMHO, using a string to determine an action is not as clear as a specific interface method for that action.		0.57740533	0.4225947

If that is the case then you need to know that this code will be compiled in something close to ,String.toUpperCase(s);, (first argument for non-static method is reserved for instance of class which method belongs to, so ,toUpperCase(), method is behind the scene more like ,toUpperCase(String this){...},) and inside it you can communicate with object represented by ,s, via ,this,)."	In other words, ,s.someMethod(), doesn't pass ,s, explicitly, but behind the scenes it is compiled as ,someMethod(s),. Similarly ,a.someMethod(b), will be compiled as ,someMethod(a,b),.

I'm having a hard time creating complex joins using Criteria API and not finding extensive documentation and examples.	@april26 - I learned via trial and error enabling OpenJPA's logging in my WAS 8 output console.  I was able to see the SQL the Criteria API was generating and tinkered with it until it spit out the query I was expecting to see.  Before that, I plowed through Hibernate and OpenJPA's manuals (both are huge but have relatively small sections on the Criteria API).  I remember an IBM article that talks about it as well.		0.5634901999999999	0.43650973

1	6103	36459	Receiving no data in streaming response/api call	Why did you decide to use ,StreamingResponseBody, when you're not actually ,streaming, the response as you're building it? The point of ,StreamingResponseBody, is that it provides a callback method for you to implement, passing the ,OutputStream, to that method, so the method can write directly to the output stream as the response is generated. Your lambda expression ,outputStream -> streamService.getLocationData(), is not using the ,outputStream, parameter, so yu get no response data. What were you trying to accomplish by using ,StreamingResponseBody,?	In order to actually stream, you need to send the ,outputStream, parameter into the ,getLocationData(), method, so it can render the next object into JSON and send it ,inside, the ,while, loop. This means that the code needs to invoke the JSON renderer itself, since if can no longer rely on the Spring framework to do it automatically. --- If you don't want to stream, don't use ,StreamingResponseBody,, and refactor the code so you only create one ,ResponseEntity,, not two, i.e. decide whether it is really the responsibility of ,getLocationData(), to create one.		0.5719622	0.42803785

I work a lot with external APIs, and I usually avoid hitting the API servers directly upon user interaction (unless it is not a get - i.e. post, delete, update, etc). I usually have a bunch of jobs running on the background at different intervals, and store the data somewhere (DB, file, etc) and then make it available thru my own APIs. When you have 500 users logged in at the same time hitting the marketcap servers all the same time, you will quickly realize that it makes more sense to get the data once, store it, and access it as often as you need virtually immediately from your own servers.	@HanletEscaño Yes I would love to do that can you please provide some code? also, can you tell me how the data will be update in the db? like...it will call the api every x time? or something else.

I updated my post to show results of a few tests that show that cloning and then iterating is OK performance wise.  But you're right that cloning isn't really super-fast, because if it was then there'd be no problem with repeatedly cloning in the loop.  And the tests show that clearly that has horrible results.	This is a tempting approach - one that I may well follow.  The frustrating thing is that I have a good no-generics design for pretty much all the API, apart from a few objects that hold lists or arrays and that people need to be able to iterate over.		0.5715048	0.42849514

0	1941	7624	Constructor versus setter injection	(1)The Java convention is to name interfaces with just a name (as you should be using the interface more than the implementation) and name implementations something different, usually something like ,ThingImpl,, ,DefaultThing,, or ,AbstractThing,.  The ,IThing, convention is more of a C#/.Net thing.	Based on the feedback here I have decided to use constructor injection and to remove the default constructor as the parent of a component can never change by design (immutable heritage).  There is a single interface type that is permitted to have an empty parent and all methods that call getParent() are aware that the top node will return null.  If any other type of class provides null in the constructor then I throw an IllegalArgumentException so that it will fail fast. I also documented in the code that parent should always be non-null (along with the exceptional case).		0.6319872	0.3680128

0	14209	43020	How do I build a full-functional RESTful API using Java Spring security	There are two kinds of tokens - access tokens and session tokens. Access tokens should not expire - the user should authenticate and request a token; that token should then be included ,as a header at least, with every request. It is a Bad Idea TM to send credentials as URL params. In an ideal world, authentication is by client certificate - that way TLS itself handles authentication. A REST application should be stateless, so session tokens should not be used.	Further ,?action=XXX, Is not REST - It’s “J. Doe’s magic API”. REST would require a URL mapped to a resource and a HTTP verb to carry out an action, for example ,GET /token, would create a token and ,DELETE /token, would invalidate a token.		0.5564386	0.44356135

I would suggest this, and then, if there is no budging, suggest that an interface can be provided that can work between the ins-and-outs, thus extracting the conversion process to a potentially generic and reusable go-between that actually understands what truly needs to happen in terms of converting.

You got it well the problem is that a session system works well in a website environement but since I have no php code, so no serverside code, I can't assume that the database will be accessed only by the client I wrote. I know it's LAN for the moment, but I don't know if it will change soon, so I'd rather have a good security from the start. Therefor, having some kind of access restriction on the server side.	Making the code in a Java SE application from the beginning, since it is connected to the database, is a problem, since any decompiler will expose the credentials of your database. Taking security into account, if you still want to make the application in Java SE, it is best to make an API on the server, and make your Java App connect to that API, without ever giving Java SE your BD credentials. You can do the API in Java EE for example, or in PHP if you have knowledge and you will add a security layer that you could not allow if you connect your client app to the BD		0.59707564	0.40292436

0	16218	47816	Unfortunately, app has stopped android when I upgrades from api 10 to api 11 or above [duplicate]	In API level 11, the default is to crash if you try to access the network on the main thread. In previous API levels, it's a bad idea, but it doesn't crash. The reason it's bad is that it freezes your entire app while the network operation happens. And if the network is slow, your app freezes for a significant time. Do your users a favour and fix the problem that Android is now making obvious (by performing network access on a different thread).	Your code is recommendable to use during testing phase not in final code, because it forcefully runs it in Main thread.	2.0	0.44858286	0.5514171999999999

Even if I add any data it doesn't reflect in the google fit app. is there some sync option I am missing??	Ok tired this and it does not bring back any errors. After this I used this code to pass it into a result. DataReadResult dataReadResult =                 Fitness.HistoryApi.readData(mClient, readRequest).await(1, TimeUnit.MINUTES); I still cant pass this into a TextView or even a toast though.		0.54253995	0.4574601
1	7486	43900	Create an API within existing web application or separate?	my main concern about adding spring security on top of my existing application is compatibility with the existing authentication system in place...or massive changes required to make it work.	I wouldn't call it a legacy application, as it will still need to function/run while/after the api is being built. I need to create a Secure REST API (thinking of using api keys or something along those lines; still researching that aspect). The application currently does use REST (mostly, but not completely) for handling data requests, but it's not completely locked down. Most of the authentication that occurs for the application is via a user login. I suspect that it will be difficult to maintain and secure the existing REST services within the web app, hence the question.		0.5923925999999999	0.40760732
