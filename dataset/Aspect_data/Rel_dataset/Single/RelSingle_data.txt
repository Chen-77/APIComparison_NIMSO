"I can't speak for JPA in general, but I found out that OpenJPA internally converts a Criteria query to JPQL and this can be printed by using OpenJPA-specific functionality (see ,openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.1.1/apache-openjpa/docs ,). The first query translates to ""SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.name = 'test Customer'"". This means it does NOT use a parameter so if this gets further translated to SQL the corresponding prepared statement will NOT use a parameter. The second version translates to the JPQL ""SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.name = :name"", so I will use parameters.   "	Will SQL injection be possible if parameters are not used?

"That is, if you do not use parameters, SQL injection is possible?   "	"That's a good thing to know. I prefer simpler code above optimized code until it is identified as a problem.

Your second answer confuses me. I always thought that (up to possible implementation bugs) parameters were guaranteed to not suffer from SQL injection attacks and I was wondering if my simpler first way can suffer from SQL injection.

"	"I was not talking about in the case of not knowing what an API method could return, but rather, in the case of having possible values passed to a method that will return null. Consider having a List<X> containing 'null' at index 4, and you call list.get(4), returning a null value for data you might've expected to be non-null. In this case, you would require a null-check because you're not sure if the method will return null. It doesn't imply a broken method; it implies an unexpected error that should be accounted for.

I'm working on a similar project. I have to create a web application (using play 20) that will fetch data from IB API. But from what I've read IB API requires either TWS or IB Gateway to be running.

Is the Java part time consuming ? You will have to consider the gateway timeout if rest APIs are into business.   	I would suggest to track the process in some in-memory cache.

"Assuming the floor is supposed to be transparent, you need to sort it into the middle of your cubes. Since it has different dimensions, it would probably be easiest to just make separate Models for the cubes above and below the floor. Then submit the three models in order from far to near. But if your floor is opaque, then you just need to draw it before you draw the transparent stuff. The trouble with transparent stuff is that you can never rely on depth testing...you have to draw all of it from far to near. Can't go back and insert something in the middle.   "	Ahh totally missed that. Finally fixed things in my game to look the way they were before i tried to batch things up... yay!I turned the depth testing on.
