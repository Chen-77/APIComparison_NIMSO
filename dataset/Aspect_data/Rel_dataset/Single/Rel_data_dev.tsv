"""The best way to avoid this type of exception is to always check for null when you did not create the object yourself."" If the caller passes null, but null is not a valid argument for the method, then it's correct to throw the exception back at the caller because it's the caller's fault. ,Silently ignoring invalid input and doing nothing in the method, is extremely poor advice because it hides the problem.   "	"To RuchirBaronia You set breakpoints on the methods around any NullPointerExceptions as seen in the stacktrace, and check the values of variables against what you expect them to be. If you know a variable is null when it shouldn't be, then you can set breakpoints around any code that changes the value. There are also conditional breakpoints you can use which will tell you when a value changes.  "	caller's	0	1	0	0	n
