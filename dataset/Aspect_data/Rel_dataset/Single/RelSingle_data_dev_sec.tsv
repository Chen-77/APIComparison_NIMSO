Solved this a few years ago exactly in this way. I thought there should be some better way. So haven't updated my solution here.   	"Hi Ben, I've tried your library and it works great while being integrated with the Java application. However, I need a version that would work on Android and I couldn't manage to generate the native library - libwkhtmltox for the android platform. I tried to recompile the source code of the wkhtmltopdf, but it appears the lib uses QtWebKit internally and as far as I know there is no support for it on Android. Do you have any ideas/tips? As I could see in your source code, there is a support for win/mac/linux, but not for the Android. Thanks a lot!  "	lib	0	1	0
