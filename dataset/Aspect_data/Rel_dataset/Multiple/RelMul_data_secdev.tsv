The second solution was pretty much what I had in mind in the first place.. but I will have to replicate all the wanted methods manually. First solution seems 'unclean' for me.. lots of clutter and unwanted code.   	"Yes, that's true. I guess that depending on what is the ratio of methods to be kept / methods to be rejected, one of the solutions might look ""cleaner"" than the other one. e.g. if you only want to forbid 2-3 methods out of 20, then A probably looks cleaner. If you only want to keep 2-3 methods out of 20, then B looks cleaner. But everything else being equal I also tend to prefer B over A.  "	A	0	1	0	0

"To Ross: Open Sound Control looks very interesting. It will get a good chunk of my time today. But it doesn't necessarily replace MIDI as much as stand in for it, at least the way I read the home page. There must be a technological leap away from MIDI, doesn't there? If we can't access synthesizers through MIDI or OSC, what do we do? That is the question I'm trying to ask. What if we have to do real interactivity with DSP? Or some other hardware? I don't know hardware... I only know a bit of MIDI and c++.   "	"To Brad, Microsoft took the midimapper and other higher level things out awhile back, the audio apis now are changing again and I don't know what support win8 will have. Google had midi support in their android/java api and took it out. Why? ow, I'm not panicking or anything but I wonder if they know something that we don't.. and BTW MIDI is serial and not ""digital"" as in Digital Signal Processing like a sampled audio file, that's what I meant. If we don't have the old MIDI serial access to an onboard chip synth, what will we have and how will we make samples or ??? as effective as MIDI?  "	midimapper	0	1	0	0

This would reduce initial ajax calls to the Rest API and may speed up rendering on the client. But I think this concept is already out of the window, because we will probably go with a Single Page App on the client which receives data solely via the Rest API (no templating/view definitions on the server). I found this guide ,ng-newsletter.com/posts/aws-js-sdk.html, which also may help me setting this up.   "	"Cool, I'll update my answer.

I really dont understand how you can connect to an external api only using a boolean ...   	"To JonathanCruz Since he is using RESTTemplate the call to external api would be something like ,String result = restTemplate.getForObject(""..., He wants to make sure that there are no pending requests before making another call that can be triggered by the user. So just check for a flag set in some static class set the flag before calling and clear it after calling. So just before calling the api if he finds that the flag is true he can ask user ti try again later.  "	RESTTemplate	0	1	0	0

Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient.

"See the ,second answer, of the duplicate, i.e. use ,restTemplateBuilder.basicAuthentication(""user"", ""password"")   "	"To MichaelKors if you are using Spring Security for your own authentication, you should be able to obtain the current headers from spring security context (Securitycontextholder.getcontext().getauthentication()). Otherwise, you can benefit of the whole process being executed in the same thread: implement a Filter to get the header and save in a ThreadLocal field of a helper class. Then in your RestTemplate interceptor get the header for that thread from the ThreadLocal. Don't forget to clean the ThreadLocal entry at the end of your filter (to avoid problems with thread re-use).  "	Security	0	1	1	1
