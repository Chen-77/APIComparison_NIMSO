I think the problem is the use of GetKeyboardState: from MSDN, sounds like it's essentially equivalent to calling GetKeyState, whereas you want the equivalent for GetAsyncKeyState, since another thread has current input focus. Perhaps try populating keystate manually with GetAsyncKeyState, or using AttachInput?   	My point is that ToUnicode should work out this shift information for you: but it needs accurate keyboard state information to work - it likely pulls the modifier information from that keyboard table, but since it's being fetched with GetKeyboardState, it does not necessarily reflect actual modifier state, which may be why it's returning unshifted characters.

You should be using Spring Security OAuth2. It is very bad practice to send credentials in a GET request like this; they should be in the ,Authorization, header so they aren't logged or cached.

To chrylis Well the flutter application's part is not in my control.

It's not a problem on your side. You are connecting to a server, and both you and the server have a certificate. This is mutual SSL authentication. The server must follow some rules and one of them is that the domain name must be specified a the subject or SAN.

Linking the two classes would probably result in bad design. When a new invoice is being created, why don't you query the ,clientService, to check if the client exists? It's the ,clientService, responsibility to have information about the clients and it's not a responsibility of the ,invoiceService,, so implementing such check inside the ,invoiceService, class wouldn't be preferable.   	I believe having createInvoice in the client class would pose the same problem, I'm not sure but just making the clientmap static in the clientServiece and just accessing it directly would do the trick so just make the map static and then just access it using clientServiece.clientMap from within the invoiceServiece class  	createInvoice	0	1	0	1	o

You can publish the API in an interface and make all implementations package local, for instance. Also, this is not true that a Java source file requires a public class: your class can be package local. You can declare ,class XX {}, in XX.java.

I second that; especially the 'extensibility' part, of course :) - However, it seems to me that many programmers fail to (fore-)see why and how users will want to extend their code - and a single method or field carelessly declared ,private, (or even lazily 'declared' package-private) can exclude a whole lot of useful extensibility.

Why not define the payload as just array of resources (objects)? And in case of single object just pass array of single resource.   	Actually, the discussion over the noun used on the path is not relevant due to the assumption that is more reliable to use plurals over singulars. Also, you are giving to the noun the responsibility to inform if it accepts something and how it does it (and thats is another assumption, but is wrong in this case). The idea of the nouns on the path are to identify to which entity they refer to.

Your JSON structure is very weird. I do not understand why you have intermediate classes like ,Borrowers, and ,Facilities, which simply wrap a list of ,Borrower, and ,Facility,. This can be simplified immensly   	"Yes it's pretty strange but it seems that he doesn't use those ""wrappers"". The problem here is probably that attribute names doesn't match (JSON vs Java). When your serializer will look for an attribute with the name ,Borrowers,, it will not find it as you called it ,borrower, in the ,CreditComplex, class. Review your code in this way. And please, do not start attributes names with upper case, it's unreadable. Edit: Didn't pay attention to the first model.

I have an application which needs to support both Username/Password and ApiKey based authentication. I had Username/Password working and after reading your posting was able to get ApiKey working. Unfortunately, I seemed to break the Username/Password. I am suspicious it is the ordering of my filters or my use of the same AuthenticationManager for both Username/Password and ApiKey auth.

Yes, but in this way I have to send the workoutID into the ConcreteExercise in the request ... otherwise it throws the exception Column 'workout_template_id' cannot be null   	If you could share your code snippet on how you are doing this anyways, looking into your request you are passing the name of the workout right? So on your service, you can get the workout by a ,findByName, repository call then from there you can now do this -> ,ConcreteExercise newExercise = new ConcreteExercise(),; then ,foundWorkoutByName.getConcreteExercises().add(newExercise),. But you have to be careful on the performance of finding ,WorkoutTemplate, by name instead of its primary key ID. You need to index it for faster search by making it ,Unique,.

Xuggler is great as long as one of the released versions will work for you and you aren't expecting any fixes or updates. Its pretty much DIY now.   	I've also tried FMJ in the past without managing to get it to work, and have spoken to others who have ended up in a similar situation!

But the amount of crashes (and I mean full on VM blowouts, not just errors and exceptions being thrown) that I've been getting when using it has been horrific. Hopefully this will improve in the future, but for a user friendly application like the one I'm trying to develop at the moment it unfortunately rules it out.  	FMJ	0	1	0	0	p

You can publish the API in an interface and make all implementations package local, for instance.

The only reason I can see for preventing the go() method in class A, B, and C from running concurrently is that they're sharing something.  If that's class data or database data, you should try to redesign so they share nothing.  That would allow them to run concurrently and not worry about interfering.  If that's not possible, then you should have one service that calls them in proper sequence to ensure that they can't be called out of order.

Note that this method just flags the document for encryption. Once it is flagged, encryption is automatic when you save with the current id file, and decryption is automatic when you open with it.  Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption. (The reason being that a signature does not give the agent access to fhe id file conttainging the key pair.)   	Ah, it's starting to come back to me... The documentation for this method is talking about using secret encryption keys, not public/private key pairs - but you can do it. I wrote an article about this many years ago.

Spring supports a basic level of aspect oriented programming (see Spring-AOP), so you could wrap an aspect that does the exception catching around your methods.

"	To MikeJRamsey56  I would simulate the user action with Robotium on the mobile device in the Then step. Checking if what I've sent to the server is reflecting on the UI. My question is how could be the approach for this integration test ?   Should I call the jmeter requests inside the steps of my mobile automation ? Should I send all the json requests before the mobile automation and check the UI after ? Should I create a helper to send the json requests inside the Given step and check the UI in the Then step?

"See the ,second answer, of the duplicate, i.e. use ,restTemplateBuilder.basicAuthentication(""user"", ""password"")   "	To MichaelKors if you are using Spring Security for your own authentication, you should be able to obtain the current headers from spring security context (Securitycontextholder.getcontext().getauthentication()). Otherwise, you can benefit of the whole process being executed in the same thread: implement a Filter to get the header and save in a ThreadLocal field of a helper class. Then in your RestTemplate interceptor get the header for that thread from the ThreadLocal. Don't forget to clean the ThreadLocal entry at the end of your filter (to avoid problems with thread re-use).  	Security	0	1	1	0	o
	Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class. I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.

getRuntime().totalMemory(), refers to the total amount of memory available to the Java runtime, not the amount of memory available to your application in particular.   	You're witnessing the garbage collector at work (not sure why you get a stack overflow tho--sounds like a bug in your test). The JVM's heap starts out empty with a small size (128MB). As more objects get created, the heap gets more full. Eventually the heap becomes so full that it triggers a full GC, causing two effects: 1) the heap size is ,increased, to 224MB, thus increasing ,totalMemory,, and 2) garbage is collected, increasing ,freeMemory,. All very normal. And it appears your JVM changes its precision of ,freeMemory, depending on... who knows. Again the behavior is within spec.  	getRuntime().totalMemory()	0	0	0	1	o

Yes, it is the point of a predicated list. But I want it to quiety ignore things that don't match the predicate, i.e. do the predicate check, but don't complain if it doesn't match.   	You are totally missing the point I'm trying to make. I do not want the nulls in the list, hence why I looked at PredicatedList. I do not want to have make a null check in all places that use the list. I'd like to pass a reference around to different things that might add to the list. If these places try adding null, I want to ignore that addition. But I do not want to force everywhere to catch the IllegalArgumentException I would get if I used a PredicatedList.

The best would be to not reinvent your security framework. Which to use depends on what you want to secure, if you want to secure services there is no ,HandlerInterceptor, that will help you. AspectJ is also applied using proxies when using Spring unless you configure compile timeweaving. However as mentioned don't try to reinvent a security framework there are plenty out there use those instead. Generally they do more then just role/group based access.

I think you need to supply an example, your question doesn't make much sense.  If you import a library and extend a class, only ,YOUR USES, of that class get extended (and overridden methods) the library remains unchanged.  If you want a default implementation, use the default class.   	If you subclass e.g. ,ArrayList, and override the ,get(int index), method to do something different, then all other methods that you haven't overridden are handled by the ,ArrayList, class code. --- You should however be aware that the result can be weird, because if you make ,get(int index), return something that isn't in the list, then someone who iterates the list will be baffled by the discrepancy.

How well this plays with maven dependencies, I also have other requirements where I need to make some database operations and doing that on JDBC would probably outweight the convenience of having the OSGI framework for supporting the runtime plugin architecture. Also, how well this standard compares to Apache Karaf?  Since In my understanding I could potentially use Karaf + JAX-RS for the REST endpoints.   	1) OSGi enRoute allows the addition of all maven dependencies through JPM. 2) Notice that OSGi is not an app server. You bring your own dependencies you do not have to depend on a limited set of standard services available. The enRoute REST is actually a POJO mapping to REST with JSON. This is a lot more OSGi and therefore easier to use than JAX-RS.  (And easy to port to JAX-RS if the need should arise one day.) 3) there is an OSGi spec for a REST API on an OSGi framework.

Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class. I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.   	To RobertJohnson - the ,FizzService, knows it needs to return a ,Fizz,, but its parent ,AbstractService, only knows the ,invoke(...), is returning an Object. But ,AbstractService, is also the parent of ,WidgetService,, which returns ,Widget,s, and of ,BuzzService,, which returns ,Buzz,s, etc. The ,mappers, are the key here: how to inject the parent ,AbstractService, with the mappers, and to call ,the correct mapper methods from insider ,invoke,.

Why not define the payload as just array of resources (objects)? And in case of single object just pass array of single resource.   	Actually, the discussion over the noun used on the path is not relevant due to the assumption that is more reliable to use plurals over singulars. Also, you are giving to the noun the responsibility to inform if it accepts something and how it does it (and thats is another assumption, but is wrong in this case). The idea of the nouns on the path are to identify to which entity they refer to. In a similar way, its possible to think that my question leads to the same wrong perspective, but it's not, because POST can deal with singles or collections. Can it accept both?  	plurals	0	1	0	1	o

You should be using Spring Security OAuth2. It is very bad practice to send credentials in a GET request like this; they should be in the ,Authorization, header so they aren't logged or cached.

API stands for ,a,pplication ,p,rogramming ,i,nterface, here is a good description: ,Wikipedia,. In general API is code that is used by other programmers to, for example, create a final product. It is kind of an utility tool. For example an API for mailing offers easy to use methods to setup and send mails, without having the full knowledge of mail protocols. So you could view the whole Java standard library as API, I would see ,library, as good synonym there.   	I would say an API consists of the whole set of classes and functions, together they form an API. But more precise the API is just the description of the input and output, it does not necessarily declare ,how, one must implement this description. This perfectly matches the concept of ,interface,s. So you could for example have someone that creates the API by just creating hundreds of ,interfaces, and their ,documentation,.

Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class. I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.

Thanks for this answer. I can't now remember why I wanted to know this. I suspect I was wondering if when the running thread updated the condition and called ,unpark,, if that would by itself guarantee the unparked thread would see the updated condition in a consistent state. It seems there is no guarantee, so the only safe choice is to explicitly arrange a memory barrier for the condition update.   	I see. If there were a ,happens-before, relationship between ,park(), and ,unpark(),, then the condition would not need to involve a memory barrier. So the question is still valid.  	park()	0	1	0	1	o

Note that this method just flags the document for encryption. Once it is flagged, encryption is automatic when you save with the current id file, and decryption is automatic when you open with it.  Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption. (The reason being that a signature does not give the agent access to fhe id file conttainging the key pair.)   	Ah, it's starting to come back to me... The documentation for this method is talking about using secret encryption keys, not public/private key pairs - but you can do it. I wrote an article about this many years ago.

JSP are not very lightweight to embed: I will need a jsp compiler and  don't feel the syntax will be a gain... Velocity or FreeMarker sounds better in this area. ECS requires basic HTML/CSS knowledge, but autocompletion helps to refresh my memory.  	ECS	0	1	0	0	p

Spring supports a basic level of aspect oriented programming (see Spring-AOP), so you could wrap an aspect that does the exception catching around your methods. Exception handling in Java is a classic use for AOP. But of course, this will not change the return type. So if your method does not declare that it returns something, your aspect will also not be able to return something suddenly. You can throw exceptions, of course.   	Yeah sure but there are multiple api endpoints that I will be exposing and I don't want a try/catch for each of the endpoint mappings.	Spring	0	1	0	0	p

Thanks for this. I would agree, it's important to maintain the consistency/integrity of data across endpoints. But (a) is more convenient imo, (e.g. when client is iterating through a list). What about going with (a) and including the quantityAvailable and priceForDates in all endpoints. quantityAvailable and priceForDates could be set to null when they aren't used or relevant. Or is this bad practice?   	I wouldn't do that. Not only I don't think it is easier for any client (iterating a list of (a) or (b) is equally simple, and (b) is better organized) but you must not add attributes to other endpoints that are not relevant in those cases just because you need them elsewhere. Option (b) is by far the best option.  	quantityAvailable	0	1	0	1	o

Yes, but the issue is both of those Exceptions share the same enum for errors and it does not clearly say anywhere which errorcode is for what exception. If I was to design that I would make 2 enums and Exception A would only throw errors with enum A and Ex B would throw stuff with exception B.

Seconding the suggestions from To Matthew Flaschen and To denisk - either store the db on a server you control and access it via a network connection, or encrypt the database and access an auth server to get access.   	I do not claim this is the best solutions ever - it's obvious that the DB should be outside the system for reasonable security level. But to fulfil the requirements that may be OK.

To Ross: Open Sound Control looks very interesting. It will get a good chunk of my time today.

I don't know hardware... I only know a bit of MIDI and c++.   	I don't see a trend towards supporting it in software so I wonder if there is going to be a lack of support in hardware. That's my concern. And if there is we need to find some other way to create musical applications.

I had no idea these functions existed in ByteBuffer. I am going to have to play with them before being able to answer definitively. I always do the assembly manually (take the high byte and shift and add to the low byte). As a guess, make sure BIG_ENDIAN is correct for both input and output & that you are actually doing this correctly on the output end. That could account for what you are hearing, if LITTLE_ENDIAN is required for playback, or if the ByteBuf is defaulting LITTLE_ENDIAN on your putShort but needs to be BIG_ENDIAN.   	Thanks for the answer. I've tried with both LITTLE and BIG, if I put LITTLE I hear only noise, if I use the code as above (by default is BIG) I can perceive the sound, but with a lot of white noise above. So I think the endian is ok. Sorry I am very new with Java, I converted bytes to short for handle values in a easier way, but how would it be working with bytes directly?  	BIG	0	1	0	0	o

I think the problem is the use of GetKeyboardState: from MSDN, sounds like it's essentially equivalent to calling GetKeyState, whereas you want the equivalent for GetAsyncKeyState, since another thread has current input focus.

My point is that ToUnicode should work out this shift information for you: but it needs accurate keyboard state information to work - it likely pulls the modifier information from that keyboard table, but since it's being fetched with GetKeyboardState, it does not necessarily reflect actual modifier state, which may be why it's returning unshifted characters.

so, where is supposed the Java runtime to be ? in the browser ?   	If you somehow convert Java objects to JSON and then load them into JavaScript (I don't know how else you would be doing this), you would be able to get the attributes that are JSON compatible (basically just strings, booleans, and numbers). Functions are not part of JSON. There is no way to represent a Java function as a generic enough object that JavaScript can also understand it.

You can publish the API in an interface and make all implementations package local, for instance.

Thanks for the answer Enmanuel. This looks more of a workaround. Do you also know how it can be handelled via ResponseEntity, as I was having touble to find an adequate source from the same. Also ResponseEntity has much more information, that I was hoping to further use.   	The thing is that the class RestTemplate throws those 3 exceptions when you use the method getForObject, getForEntity, exchange, etc. RestTemplate has something called ResponseErrorHandler, which as the name suggests, handles the errors. By default, RestTemplate uses the implementation DefaultResponseErrorHandler which throws the exception when there's an HTTP response 4XX or 5XX. So, if you want to work the way you are trying, you need to implement your own ResponseErrorHandler.

To Marcus: it may well be an internal app, but designing something with built-in limitations at this stage is a bad idea.  You may ,think, it will never need to scale, but can you be sure?

The only reason I can see for preventing the go() method in class A, B, and C from running concurrently is that they're sharing something.  If that's class data or database data, you should try to redesign so they share nothing.  That would allow them to run concurrently and not worry about interfering.  If that's not possible, then you should have one service that calls them in proper sequence to ensure that they can't be called out of order.

Not totally positive what you're trying to do, but I would consider using the javax.validation package.  We use the ,hibernate implementation,.  In our application we have a ,To Controller, that accepts a ,Command Object, that has its validation rules as annotations.  You'll need to write your own validation rule where that field cannot be true/false strings, consider doing a ,.equalsIgnoreCase(), and then in the controller you check to see if there were validation errors and return the http response you want.

To Marcus: it may well be an internal app, but designing something with built-in limitations at this stage is a bad idea.  You may ,think, it will never need to scale, but can you be sure?  Save yourself the headache later down the line and adhere to some best practice!   	The only reason I can see for preventing the go() method in class A, B, and C from running concurrently is that they're sharing something.  If that's class data or database data, you should try to redesign so they share nothing.  That would allow them to run concurrently and not worry about interfering.  If that's not possible, then you should have one service that calls them in proper sequence to ensure that they can't be called out of order.  In either case, I think your design is flawed and the cure will be worse than the disease.  	B	0	0	0	0	n

getRuntime().totalMemory(), refers to the total amount of memory available to the Java runtime, not the amount of memory available to your application in particular.   	You're witnessing the garbage collector at work (not sure why you get a stack overflow tho--sounds like a bug in your test). The JVM's heap starts out empty with a small size (128MB). As more objects get created, the heap gets more full. Eventually the heap becomes so full that it triggers a full GC, causing two effects: 1) the heap size is ,increased, to 224MB, thus increasing ,totalMemory,, and 2) garbage is collected, increasing ,freeMemory,. All very normal. And it appears your JVM changes its precision of ,freeMemory, depending on... who knows. Again the behavior is within spec.  	freeMemory	0	0	0	1	o

I would have a separate class, with its own getters, for encapsulating the result.  Have ,doExecuteMySpecialAlgorithm, return an instance of that class.   	Yes, I think your update is more relevant to my question. The downside of having a single method is, that this single method would have to effectively return the output. But let's just say that there are multiple outputs. So for instance, my algorithm is probably creating two lists. Your suggestion would require me to create a class that will hide these two lists and my method would have to return an instance of this class. Well, now if you think about it, this return class is anemic in nature. It is serving as an empty container. Not quite useful? Reminds me of the anemic VO/DTO pattern.  	It	0	0	0	0	o

Thanks for this. I would agree, it's important to maintain the consistency/integrity of data across endpoints. But (a) is more convenient imo, (e.g. when client is iterating through a list). What about going with (a) and including the quantityAvailable and priceForDates in all endpoints. quantityAvailable and priceForDates could be set to null when they aren't used or relevant. Or is this bad practice?   	I wouldn't do that. Not only I don't think it is easier for any client (iterating a list of (a) or (b) is equally simple, and (b) is better organized) but you must not add attributes to other endpoints that are not relevant in those cases just because you need them elsewhere. Option (b) is by far the best option.  	(b)	0	1	0	0	n

To RobertHarvey: To clarify, why do you say ,totalMemory, is not going to work for To MattB?

How well this plays with maven dependencies, I also have other requirements where I need to make some database operations and doing that on JDBC would probably outweight the convenience of having the OSGI framework for supporting the runtime plugin architecture. Also, how well this standard compares to Apache Karaf?  Since In my understanding I could potentially use Karaf + JAX-RS for the REST endpoints.   	1) OSGi enRoute allows the addition of all maven dependencies through JPM. 2) Notice that OSGi is not an app server. You bring your own dependencies you do not have to depend on a limited set of standard services available. The enRoute REST is actually a POJO mapping to REST with JSON. This is a lot more OSGi and therefore easier to use than JAX-RS.  (And easy to port to JAX-RS if the need should arise one day.) 3) there is an OSGi spec for a REST API on an OSGi framework.	enRoute	0	1	0	0	o

Thanks for the answer. This is exactly what I was looking for. Just one more thing. I think adding the LoopController to the ThreadGroup is enough.

To Ross: Open Sound Control looks very interesting. It will get a good chunk of my time today. But it doesn't necessarily replace MIDI as much as stand in for it, at least the way I read the home page. There must be a technological leap away from MIDI, doesn't there? If we can't access synthesizers through MIDI or OSC, what do we do? That is the question I'm trying to ask. What if we have to do real interactivity with DSP? Or some other hardware? I don't know hardware... I only know a bit of MIDI and c++.

Linking the two classes would probably result in bad design. When a new invoice is being created, why don't you query the ,clientService, to check if the client exists?

As I wrote in my question, the direct way will be introduce synchronisation on particular entities's ids. This will simply prevent DB from being locked, so it will be no any hassles with timeout exceptions - sequentially executed DELETE methods will quickly return OK, as deleting of an absent entity in my API is legal operation.

A lot of the timeout settings can be controlled at the JVM level (see Snicolas' response). Others, you have to set them up at the OS level, and you have to make them a OS-level ,pre-condition, for your java app. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your problem, but it seems to me that at some point, your JVM deployment ,must, make some assumptions about what is being provided by the underlying OS. Good question though (+1 for you).   	I sort of agree with you on this (that this is a OS-level task, not a JVM one.)

I am not familiar with that API but what is the issue if two different exceptions share same error codes?  isn't ,EDAMSystemException, and ,EDAMUserException , be thrown in distinct situations / events( that seems obvious from exception names ) ? Why are you using single catch for both exceptions? I guess its your coding issue to be concerned only about error codes without being bothered about actual cause of issue. I think, same kind of error can be thrown on two different and distinct events - some activity by user and some system action.   	Yes, but the issue is both of those Exceptions share the same enum for errors and it does not clearly say anywhere which errorcode is for what exception. If I was to design that I would make 2 enums and Exception A would only throw errors with enum A and Ex B would throw stuff with exception B. As it stands it kinda indicates that those errors could share some codes, but its not defined clearly which ones. Thats why I wanted to handle them in the same clause (Cant figure out which exception is thrown with which errorCode - not well documented)  	EDAMUserException	0	0	0	1	o

You should be using Spring Security OAuth2. It is very bad practice to send credentials in a GET request like this; they should be in the ,Authorization, header so they aren't logged or cached.

Use can use either some interceptor or aspect to do so.   	The main reason I want to unit test this is so that if anyone changes my code, i.e. the way I've implemented the library into our product, they won't be able to break it.

It's not a problem on your side. You are connecting to a server, and both you and the server have a certificate. This is mutual SSL authentication. The server must follow some rules and one of them is that the domain name must be specified a the subject or SAN. If you check the stackoverflow certificate in your browser (the green lock) you will see that it was issued to *.stackexchange.com (not the domain you are connecting to), but one of the SANS is *.stackoverflow.com (which is the right domain).

There's only ,one way, to resolve these kind of disagreements.   	Agreed.

thanks. I guess it's a completely different way to consider the API. What about if it's not about accessing resources, but rather performing actions?

If your operations are not on resources (things identified via a web URL) then REST is not a appropriate style to use. You can perform actions either using HTTP methods as verbs, or by creating another resource which is the result of the action and navigating to that resource.
