"What do you mean with ""The idea of using the Builder would be to abstract the building of the Composite transaction from the underlying implementation.""? The tree-structure itself is a giant composite object (with ""pointers""). I'm not sure if it's worth the effort. We have used the methods internally so often, and I would have to rewrite a bunch of code. But luckily we do not have any external users as of now ;-) So I can change virtually anything and I want to provide a clean nice API.   "	"To Johannes - Composites are generally built using Builders.  So as long as the tree structure is viewed as a composite object rather than as a document or single datasource, it's worth considering.  The idea is to abstract the construction to a director so that you're guaranteed proper creation.  "	Builders	0	1	0	0	p

"PUT and POST are meant for different things. Generally speaking if you want to create a NEW record in your service, then you use a POST.  However, if you have an existing record and you want to (UPDATE IT), meaning you need to retrieve it from the DB, Update, Save, then that is a PUT.

"Why did you decide to use ,StreamingResponseBody, when you're not actually ,streaming, the response as you're building it?
