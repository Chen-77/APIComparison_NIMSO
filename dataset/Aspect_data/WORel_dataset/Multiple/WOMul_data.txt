Based on the feedback here I have decided to use constructor injection and to remove the default constructor as the parent of a component can never change by design (immutable heritage).  There is a single interface type that is permitted to have an empty parent and all methods that call getParent() are aware that the top node will return null.  If any other type of class provides null in the constructor then I throw an IllegalArgumentException so that it will fail fast. I also documented in the code that parent should always be non-null (along with the exceptional case).	getParent()	0	0	0	1	o

"Just a quick addition to this: after step 2, you need to run the SDK Manager and download the platform SDKs you want to use.  If you don't do this before step 4, ,you have to restart Eclipse to get it to see the platforms,, as it will only read the list of available targets once per session.  I believe you can also trick it into rereading the list by copying your SDK to a different location and then pointing it at the new copy, but it's probably easier just to restart it."	SDK	0	1	0	0	o

"I was not seeing underscores. Most database developers and administrators that work with Microsoft SQL Server prefer camel case for table and column names, as opposed to using the underscores approach that JPA and Spring assume to be the default. For example, most of the time in Java/Spring you expect a tabkle name of ""MY_TABLE"", but in SQL Server you will probably have a table name of ""MyTable"". Since this is non-standard in the spring ecosystem, you need to specify a different naming strategy."	Microsoft	0	1	0	0	o

Ive tried that now and it still returns empty brackets.  When I call the getLadokResultsArrayList() method from the same package it works ((but another class and .java file). It also works to print it out in console from the same package..  But when I go into the web application and call the method it doesn't work. Hence is the problem how I declare the instance variable? It is now declared public ( public  List<ResultLadok> resultList  = new ArrayList();).  I guess the problem is then: why can't I call the application project from my webb application?	getLadokResultsArrayList()	0	1	0	0	o

"Actually, the discussion over the noun used on the path is not relevant due to the assumption that is more reliable to use plurals over singulars. Also, you are giving to the noun the responsibility to inform if it accepts something and how it does it (and thats is another assumption, but is wrong in this case). The idea of the nouns on the path are to identify to which entity they refer to.
