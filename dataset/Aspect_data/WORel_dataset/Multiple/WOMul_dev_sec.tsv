Based on the feedback here I have decided to use constructor injection and to remove the default constructor as the parent of a component can never change by design (immutable heritage).  There is a single interface type that is permitted to have an empty parent and all methods that call getParent() are aware that the top node will return null.  If any other type of class provides null in the constructor then I throw an IllegalArgumentException so that it will fail fast. I also documented in the code that parent should always be non-null (along with the exceptional case).	getParent()	0	0	0	1	o

"To nathanb - I think that would more likely lead to garbage data and potential memory overwrites on the C side. I took a glance at the spotify API. As you said, sp_artist is intentionally opaque. An instance is obtainable from methods that return an sp_artist* -- search for ""SP_LIBEXPORT(sp_artist *)"". At a glance, looks like the first function you would call would be sp_session_create(), which takes a non-opaque struct. That might be an easier place to start. BTW, JNA provides a Pointer type."	spotify	0	0	0	0	o

"What are you using for your REST layer and what are you using for XML/JSON binding?  I'm using Jersey and EclipseLink MOXy.

Essentially, I'm able to handle a PUT that only contains some fields. To do this, I wrote some code for MOXy that gives me a List of setters that were called during the unmarshalling process.

"Yes, that's true. I guess that depending on what is the ratio of methods to be kept / methods to be rejected, one of the solutions might look ""cleaner"" than the other one. e.g. if you only want to forbid 2-3 methods out of 20, then A probably looks cleaner. If you only want to keep 2-3 methods out of 20, then B looks cleaner. But everything else being equal I also tend to prefer B over A."	A	0	1	0	0	o

"To Andrew. Not coupling to the host but to the properties keys them selves. Think about this, java.lang.System was among the first classes in Java. Back then they didn't quite knew what was going to be the platform like. It was aimed for TV sets, Futurist devices ( such as *7 ) among other things. My guess ( because as S.Lott correctly points out only James Gosling and the original team will know now ) is they thought different platforms may return different system properties."	java.lang.System	0	0	0	1	o
