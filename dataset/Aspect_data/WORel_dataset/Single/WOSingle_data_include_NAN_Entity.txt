"? is a shorthand notation; internally compiler replaces it with a type parameter anyway; when there's compiler error, you'll see the surrogate type parameter, instead of the ?"				
"To irreputable while it is more complicated indeed, your point about replacing it with a type parameter is entirely valid; it's just one that you can't declare."				
"if we look at ,just, these two methods as they are - there is no difference and just a matter of style; otherwise (if you add some more generic parameters), things will change"				
"Thank you very much, your explanation is very clear and instructive"				
"To Tony: The book also has a short discussion on how to choose between wildcard vs type parameter when there is no bound. Essentially, if the type parameter appears only once in a method declaration, use wildcard. See also the ,reverse(List<?>), example from JLS ,java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/third_edition/html "	reverse(List<>)

Is the only difference that you call it API key instead of username or is there anything else?	username			
Is this below answer resolved your problem? how did you managed your users and api key for each user?				
"this was quite helpful. I have an application which needs to support both Username/Password and ApiKey based authentication. I had Username/Password working and after reading your posting was able to get ApiKey working. Unfortunately, I seemed to break the Username/Password.

"To marcellorvalle Typically, the client of an API secured with an API key is another service.  If you're inferring that the client of this API would be a web browser, I would suggest you look into OAuth / JWT tokens for user authorization."				
"Useful must-read : ,REST Security Cheat Sheet / API Keys"				
"this really worked for me. but, is it recommended using in production?"				
"API keys in general are less secure than, say OAuth.  But they are simpler, which is part of the appeal.  Weather or not this trade-off is worth it depends on your needs and how your application is deployed.  My particular application was an internal application, not accepting connections from the outside world, so the trade-off was worth it in my case.  But I would not, for example, deploy an API key to a mobile application as the sole security mechanism because any user of the application will be able to get that API key."	API			
"To mattforsythe You are correct but api keys are usually meant to be used in private environment. To use it in a mobile application, in theory, you need to create some kind of proxy with your backend."				
"To WannyMiarelli, correct.  As I mentioned in my comment, my application was a private, internal one that did not accept connections from the outside internet.  This is what made it ideal in my case.  I think we are saying the same thing, right?"				
"How can I combine it with a bearer token filter, such that api keys authorizated requests will get a different group than the token requests. In such a way that I can use it with To PreAuthorize.

"To RobertHarvey: To clarify, why do you say ,totalMemory, is not going to work for To MattB? Looking at this question as it is currently phrased, To MattB wants to measure the memory use of his Java program running on a single JVM instance. For this scenario, ,totalMemory - freeMemory, is correct. The results of ,totalMemory, are not affected by other JVM instances (i.e., processes) running on the same machine. And To MattB makes no mention of other programs running inside the same JVM instance as his program. How is ,totalMemory, not correct?"	totalMemory			
"Thank you for your response cambecc.  This gives me some insight to my problem, although if I add, for example, more fields to NewObject class (such as more NewObject) I should be able to see a memory increase with my program, but I get a stack overflow instead.  Running your main method, I get the following, which appears to be pretty unreliable, as it fluctuates from more to less to more again...  (I've added to the main questions, since formatting is messy for a comment)"				
"BTW, ,Diff, is ,not, the amount of used memory. It is a measurement of the precision of ,freeMemory,, i.e., the difference between the previously reported amount of ,freeMemory, and the current reported amount.

"""I will occasionally document private and package private methods for my own benefit"". This is fine if you are the only person who is ever going to look at the code, but not otherwise."				
I don't think this answers the question. It only describes what you normally do. I would like to know why.				
"""Classes which have public members but which are not intended for external consumption are prominently marked in the class javadoc."" <-- How do you mark them?"	javadoc			
"I would argue that documenting every single method for the sake of thoroughness is a bad idea. It leads to cluttered, poor quality documentation. Code should be self describing as much as possible. Putting docs on that is a waste of time for you and the reader. The increased noise level makes it hard to see the docs that are actually important. The volume of nonsense docs increases the chance of docs becoming obsolete without being updated. ""setName() Sets the name. \To param name The name to set."" ""getName() Gets the name. \To return The name."""	name

"Do you ask ""what is the use of StringBuilder"" or ""Why use StringBuilder in this case""? Generally StringBuilder is for fast string building and concatenation (as the name suggests).

(3) There are Java evironments where object creation is extremely expensive (Java Card). Here object creation should be avoided whenever possible"

I did have a groovy script that would associate the code jars with the sources jars from maven by editing the Eclipse .classpath . I don't use the Maven plugin but I have to imagine it does this association automatically.	Maven			
Sure I can see that. But its a pain in the butt to then associate myproject-api.jar myproject-api-src.jar so that you can see the javadoc via code completion. Does the Maven Eclipse plugin do this?				
I also can't imagine download size being an issue (i mean it is 2010 a couple 100k should not be a problem). So create the separate jars but have the *-api.jar also have the source.

Sure i don't argue that what i'm saying is notExist() is unneccassary!  what can you achive with notExist() when there is an exist() method ??	notExist()			
"Note that the result of both methods are immediately outdated. So they give you a check (valid of the moment of the call) is a file exists/not exists. Respectively, this is what you can achieve with them. If you had no ,notExists,, you would call ,exists, and if it returns false, you would conclude the file does not exist. But as the JavaDoc says, this conclusion is incorrect (as ,notExists, may be returning also false at the same time). Yes, it is a bit confusing :) OK."	exists			
if exist() would return true in case file exist and false if doesn't and throw security exception IMHO could be much more clear and easy to understand than current design.	exist()			
OK everyone can have an opinion. I am not defending any decisions design here. Just trying to answer your question.				
Thanks buddy! my primary question was about the design. That was my mistake to putting two different question in one :). maybe because i couldn't understand the intention of methods. now it sound all clear to me :)	design			
Sure i don't argue that what i'm saying is notExist() is unneccassary!  what can you achieve with notExist() when there is an exist() method ??	notExist()			
"Since ,exists()==false, does not prove the non existence of a file, you can use ,notExists(), for the cases when you want to check if the file does not exists, e.g., before creating a new file."	notExists()			
i see know! however still not clear why API designed this way? if exist() would return true in case file exist and false if doesn't and throw security exception IMHO could be much more clear and easy to understand than current design.	exist()

"Familiar is definitely good.  But I think a checked exception would be pretty cumbersome for that sort of parsing method.  Like parsing integers, sometimes you want to parse user input that is likely to be invalid (and so you want to catch and handle the exception explicitly), but often you're parsing something that you expect to be valid, and then having to deal with a checked exception would be a pain."	Familiar			
"To MB: True. One thing you could do is provide different functions for those two cases, e.g., ,parse, for the first case and the ,parseOrNull, or ,uncheckedParse, for the latter.

Also it does not really conform to any KISS, or InDoubtLeaveItOut principles."	Core

"Hi Ben, I've tried your library and it works great while being integrated with the Java application. However, I need a version that would work on Android and I couldn't manage to generate the native library - libwkhtmltox for the android platform. I tried to recompile the source code of the wkhtmltopdf, but it appears the lib uses QtWebKit internally and as far as I know there is no support for it on Android. Do you have any ideas/tips? As I could see in your source code, there is a support for win/mac/linux, but not for the Android. Thanks a lot!"	lib			
"While the library is thread-safe, it unfortunately cannot perform conversions concurrently.

"YUK!  I strongly disagree to this justification - i think if you want a use case where diferent types can be used as valid keys, then create overrides or extra methods that constrain the usage.  That way you have a strongly typed, clearly documented interface that indicates the intended usage.  Any generic that has an Object parameter being used is an indication of poor design IMO.  This design leaves itself to potentially dangerous situations."				
"Even if you think it's ugly, that is exactly how the Map interface and Object#equals method are defined in the API documentation. When adding generics to the Map interface, care had to be taken to not alter the defined behaviour of the interface methods. Forcing the parameter to the get method to actually be of the same type as the generic K type would be a non backward-compatible change to the interface definition."	generics			
"To newacct: in that example, the values have the same type - java.util.List - even though not the same class. That would be good enough to use a more tightly constrained get. You can come up with more outlandish scenarios where valid keys share no type more specific than Object, but i can't imagine they're scenarios i would want to be possible!"				
"To newacct: but if you declare a Map<List, SomeOtherType>, you can use any type of List. Your example (equality between different List implementations) would only be an issue if someone were to declare a Map<ArrayList, SomeOtherType> and subsequently tried to call get() using a LinkedList; again, a very ugly hack."	LinkedList			
"You can get round this problem with wildcards by pushing the variable into a method with a type parameter of its own - eg ,<T> void duplicateFirst(List<T> l) {T first = l.get(0); l.add(0, first);},.

"Please don't abuse ,IllegalStateException,. There is no state involved here."	IllegalStateException			
"To Grodriguez, offered another option, the actual choice of exception is up to the application model of course, and could opt for a state exception imho."				
"According to the documentation, the ,IllegalStateException, ""signals that a method has been invoked at an illegal or inappropriate time. In other words, the Java environment or Java application is not in an appropriate state for the requested operation."" This is obviously misleading as the disabled methods are meant to throw the exception always, not depending on the application state or on the timing of the call."	IllegalStateException			
"To Grodriguez, I have seen the use of ,IllegalStateException, in situations where the classes represent states in a model, where the methods are called through an interface reference, making its use a valid one. As we don't know the context of the OP, I didn't want to assume his situation is different."	IllegalStateException			
"That would be reasonable, but it doesn't seem to be the case for the OP, since what he originally was trying to do was to ,""reduce the visibility of certain methods"",. This isn't allowed in Java, but if it was allowed, obviously it would not depend on any application state. Edit: I see you already changed that to ,UnsupportedOperationException,."

"I think a criteria API pulls in the wrong direction from having a SQL builder API. On my current project, the original (and long gone) developers used a criteria API, and the current team hates it.

If you know the correct SQL already, why count on a SQL generator?"

Hardcoded SQL kills some independencie."				
"The example above is using normal SQL which is bad because it usually means that your app just became dependent on one specific SQL engine as opposed to being able to run on any DB back-end. Instead, it is suggested to use HQL (Hibernate Query Language) which gets translated to SQL under-the-hood. This approach still uses strings however so refactorings can break stuff.

"To user1445967 - I'm not sure I understand the comment. Of course one can (usually) look inside a file with Java (by opening and reading it). The point of the answer is that this particular method will decide whether a file is a ""regular file"" (as opposed to a directory, symbolic link, or other [e.g., ,/dev/tt0, on Unix]) based only on information from outside the file itself. It's not that there is such a thing as a ""file with opaque content"", it's simply that this method doesn't use the file contents when deciding whether or not it is a regular file."	link			
"I can't speak for JPA in general, but I found out that OpenJPA internally converts a Criteria query to JPQL and this can be printed by using OpenJPA-specific functionality (see ,openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.1.1/apache-openjpa/docs ,). The first query translates to ""SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.name = 'test Customer'"". This means it does NOT use a parameter so if this gets further translated to SQL the corresponding prepared statement will NOT use a parameter. The second version translates to the JPQL ""SELECT c FROM Customer c WHERE c.name = :name"", so I will use parameters."	OpenJPA			
"After some more testing I found that writing the same query with JPQL and using name ""' OR 'x'='x"" injects JPQL. When using the criteria API, the generated JPQL that OpenJPA logs looks exactly same. However the actual SQL that is logged by OpenJPA then uses a prepared statement with a parameter of value ""' OR 'x'='x"" instead of '' in the JPQL case. This means SQL injection does not work here! Unfortunately I have no idea how reliable this is. It seems that this an undocumented feature."

"After dealing with it a few times in code, I'm pretty sure it's that way just to make maintenance programmers angry at the API designer.  :-)  Greenfield programmers end up passing around LinkedList (instead of List) so they can use getLast().  Maintenance guys figure out that ArrayList is more appropriate and have to deal with all these specified LinkedLists that really should have been List in the first place (and probably would have been except for this one critical failure in the List interface)..."	LinkedList			
Good explanation. Makes me wonder why there's an isEmpty method though.	isEmpty			
To peskal With Java 8 we can use isEmpty as a method reference which is nice.	isEmpty			
To Thorbj酶rnRavnAndersen but it existed far before Java 8 ;)				
I sometimes wish they had added it to ArrayList too at least. Writing arraylist.get(arraylist.size() - 1) over and over again is kind of a boilerplate.	ArrayList			
To Charlie: Unless you work with a list interface and don't want to ever directly know what's your underlying implementation.	Unless			
"To akarnokd Then you would have to change all your code, and make readers wonder why the custom list, all of that just for a ,getLast(), convenience. I find it annoying too that it's not in the list interface, I understand the minimalist approach, but sometimes you gain a lot by just adding a tiny bit of help, like ,isEmpty(),."	getLast()			
"No, an interface's goal is to seperate implementation from interface. The type of operations have nothing to do with it."	interface			
"I'm not sure I agree, but I guess it depends on how likely someone is to want the last item from a list."	list			
I wonder what other list implementations are possible apart from the built in LinkedList/ArrayList in witch a common getFirst() getLast() interface method wouldn't have been O(1)?	LinkedList/ArrayList			
"To skaffman: You're correct. That is the ,main, goal of an interface, of course. I'm talking more from the perspective of a secondary goal. I will update my answer to reflect this."	correct			
"With the arrival of Java 8's ,default, methods, you can have the best of both worlds by providing nice methods for the users of the interface without forcing the implementers to write them themselves. So they could add a ,default T getLast(), and everybody would be happy."	Java			
The Deque interface was only introduced in Java 6. The LinkedList class (with its getLast() method) predates this by several versions (introduced in 1.2).	getLast()			
Unless it just stored the last element in a field. How do you think getSize() is implemented?	getSize()			
If you look at the LinkedList implementation it contains an optimization for the index based lockup: If the index is after the half size of the list then then the traversal starts at the end and goes backwards. This way a get(size - 1) is practically has the same time cost as getLast().	LinkedList			
"To kd304, that is an implementation detail that doesn't address the general case of index based lookups not being optimal for LinkedList. There is no contract on LinkedList that states that certain index based lookups will be fast."				
"To Adamski -  I like this. But if the caller is already throwing the Exception, this exception would be muted right? For e.g. I have seen NumberFormatException not handled because the caller already throws the Exception.  So, is there a corollary rule - a method should never throw the ""Exception"" itself?"	NumberFormatException			
"I am of the opinion that if the element cannot be found, the caller shouldn't have called the method from the start at all. You could have a check method, so you can write if(hasElement('test')) getMandatoryChildElement('test');. Much better than the try-catch-try next method sort of code. How would you write a 'load file' method?"	getMandatoryChildElement('test')			
"To disown : the problem is giving a method in an API. You don't know the user, so you have to make sure he won't be doing bad things, and tell him when he's doing wrong.  To srini.venigalla : if the caller already throws Exception, he's gonna catch it somewhere sooner or later."	API

"What is the benefit of having a custom checked exception like AxisException or SoapException or WhateverException? All you can deduce from this is that the exception came from the lib, which you knew anyway from the stacktrace. If you want to do catch-all error handling, it's easily added in the client."				
To disown: nobody is disputing that...  There's not much point.  Also some will dispute the very concept of checked exceptions altogether and there are certainly very successful languages that are doing perfectly fine and that will continue to do perfectly fine without them.  Some even view checked exceptions as glorified GOTO statements so it is for sure a debatable topic.				
"I would also add, that if the API allows me to set a value to null, then it should darn well be a null when I get it.  Throwing an exception in this scenario would be very inconsistent."	API			
+1 to you - If only someone can put a value around the time spent on fixing null problems and memcpy problems..

It sounds like you try to reinvent the wheel with the Aether library. so i would take a deep look into the Aether lib and may be ask on their mailing list to see if a possibility exist to use a different artifact resolver (downloading later etc.). I doubt but just try it.	Aether

"Feel free to star it on Github: ,github.com/jcabi/jcabi-aether/stargazers, :)"	)			
One of the problems i don't like using Aether it's that i have to create a temporary repository just for fetching an artifact into it. I don't want Aether to download the file. I just want to know which is latest version of the artifact and where is it on the network. Imagine that i have an application distribution zip which doesn't have any dependant artifacts so it's just standing alone. I can fetch that easily by myself or even better unpack it on the fly while downloading.	Aether			
This is not absolutely programmatic. It needs predefined XML files which are defining the dependencies and other configurations. What if those are determined dynamically during execution (fetched from an external source)? I don't like to have temporary files all over the place.	It

In general, unit tests have the precondition that they pass compilation without errors -- and, more often, without warnings.

And I totally agree with that comment but my question is: how can I find 0ut through code what this not reported memory adds up to?				
"The short answer - you cannot - at least through the android api (at this point in time).

(Also voted up your question because I see no reason for it to have been voted down)."

"I think there is no way because it's limited by the hardware. Your device has 512mb physically, but the hardware splits it up between gpu and memory available to the system. You could perhaps find out about the memory available to the gpu and add that to the value the system reports. But I don't know if there's a way to find out if the gpu memory is on the same physical chip. Of course if both add up to a power of 2 when either of them is no power of 2, that would be a strong hint because AFAIK, all RAM modules ship with a memory amount that is a power of 2."	RAM

"first revision: ""I could write anal setters"". Wow ... whatever way you want to swing with your setters I won't judge."				
"Thanks for the reply. Some follow up questions:  (1) Actually my interfaces don't end in 'Interface' usually but do start with 'I'. Is there a standard naming convention for interfaces in Java? I always thought it was a matter of preference but would happily change if a convention exists.  (2) The '_' for member variables I also assumed was a matter of coding style. If it doesn't affect the getter/setter names I thought it was ok.  (3) If I was to use constructor injection, I would remove the setParent() method and allow a null parent reference in the constructor (no default constructor). OK?"	setParent()			
And thanks for taking the time to give me a very detailed answer.				
"(1)The Java convention is to name interfaces with just a name (as you should be using the interface more than the implementation) and name implementations something different, usually something like ,ThingImpl,, ,DefaultThing,, or ,AbstractThing,.  The ,IThing, convention is more of a C#/.Net thing."				
"(2)The ,_field, naming - in Java it's pretty standard to do ,this.field, instead... though you're right it doesn't bleed into the external interface.  You may run into some issues if you decide to use APIs that uses reflection or annotations to figure out properties... most of them are pretty good at figuring out the property through the public API, but you may run into some cases where you set an annotation on the field and it can't find the methods that map to it because it's looking for ,set_myField(),/,get_myField(), or wants to map the field to a ,_myField, database column or something."	You			
"(3) So 'parentage' is really an immutable property?  A component won't be able to move around the hierarchy?  I still don't like using ,null, as a ""magic"" parameter in the public API... If anything, I'd make at least 3 classes - an abstract implementation that allows ,null, as a parent parameter, a top level implementation that provides a default constructor and calls ,super(null),, and another (possibly abstract) implementation that's used for child components that provides only the constructor that takes a parent, and throws an exception if ,null, is passed to it, to make it clear."				
Is it bad IOC practise to not supply a default constructor at all (therefore to enforce the interface version of the constructor)?	practise			
To Chris - don't think you can call it good or bad practice.  It depends on the way you've designed your classes to be wired.				
"Actually, I was considering asking this as part of the original question but glad to see that you've answered it anyway.  I wouldn't be enthusiastic about adding Spring-Specific annotations to the code. My feeling is that the interface itself should be responsible for prohibiting non-intended use so that the protection is afforded to all usage vectors of the API (Spring/Java/PicoContainer/etc.)."

If we don't have the old MIDI serial access to an onboard chip synth, what will we have and how will we make samples or ??? as effective as MIDI?"	midimapper

Are you really advocating single-threaded producer/consumer in this day and age of multi-core CPUs?"	single-threaded			
"not advocating single threaded producer/consumer, I am saying that incorrect attempts at throwing threads at problems causes more problems that are much harder to solve.

On an i3 setting threads = 2 or i7 threads = 4 is about 25% faster than including all the ""threads"" when compiling.

Auto-(un)boxing millions of primitives and generating millions of needless objects is a sure way to kill the perfs. Which is why for big collections of primitives the default Java API and stuff based on clean OO simply doesn't cut it. That's when you use things like Trove. It comes down to your requirements."

"To Njol Yeah that is just the example, I would hold a reference in the class. I can update"

"""I had to also keep a reference to that listener elsewhere just to stop it getting GC"" Keeping another reference to the listener? Doesn't it make the WeakReference senseless then?"	listener			
Yes. That's why I removed the weak references. However there are cases where it might be useful. If you have business objects that are being used elsewhere and are also listeners then you might want to add them to listen to things but still have them GCd. Even that isn't ideal though as you could drop all references to something but it would still be receiving events for an unknown time afterwards and wasting resources. Basically in the end I decided that weak references just aren't useful for listeners.

Thus, I endorse ,careful, and reflected use of visibilites; and in that, I think, we agree after all."	visibilites			
"If a class is not carefully designed to be extendable, and is not intended to be extended, it should be final. That's another recommendation of Josh Bloch, IIRC.

My date library does no underlying date calculations at all. It is simply a wrapper around the Java Date/Calendar API which makes a distinction between a year-month-day and an instant in time.

Agreed; personally I found Ruby confusing as actual language constructs could be achieved in multiple ways (blocks/yield etc).				
I see your point. But my tests aren't testing the creation factories; they're testing the dates which those factories return. Or they might not even be tests of Date at all; but another class which needs a date in some way.

"If you want to try and restrict what app people are using to connect to your service, I think the best you can do is store a global secret in the app and use that to 'authenticate' that the request comes from a specific app. Anyone who is determined could extract that secret and then log in from anywhere (or publish the secret allowing anyone to log in from anywhere)."

The JavaMail Reference Implementation comes with protocol providers for SMTP, IMAP, and POP3.  See the ,JavaMail FAQ, for more details."

"I'm accepting this answer because I mentioned I want it published as an enum and there is no other way of doing it. Although I went on a different path because I wanted to expose some of the additional functionality (but not all), and obviously it is undesirable to duplicate the additional functionality. Instead I exposed the enums as interfaces where the additional functionality that I want to publish are part of the interface, and enum constants are also listed as interface constants. This solution also avoids having to make conversions and implementation changes."	enum			
"The enum is used from multiple packages of the library, so I cannot reduce visibility. This implies the composition is also not a good solution (because it uses restricted access)."				
"The problem with this as mentioned in the question is that the enum is used from multiple packages of the library, so the visibility of additional attributes and methods cannot be reduced."	enum			
"Maybe instead of this you can try to expose attributes with getter methods and even returning defensive copies to defend yourself from misuse?  If this is not possible, then I am afraid that you will need to redesign your library with a strict division between private logic and public DTOs visible to the API user."				
"The attribute was just an example (it's shorter than a method), but the same visibility applies to methods too. The original problem comes from I want to use Enums and Enums cannot extend your own class. With class hierarchy this would not be a problem (I could publish the ancestor class and keep hidden the subclass from the public API)."

"If my starting point was on the vertex of one of the Polygons and travels to another vertex on the same Polygon, then only checking the border does not catch this intersection right? Since each Polygon is a solid object, my path would not be able to travel through it and only checking the borders would result in a false positive. However, if I checked any combination of lines between the points of the Polygon, it would correctly catch this error."				
"Okey, so by intersect you mean that this line must start outside the polygon, goes through it, and end again outside?"	polygon			
"Ohh... I understand - you think about the situation when one vertex of your line lays exactly at border of polygon, yes?"				
"No, I mean it is not allowed to intersect the polygon as it is a solid shape. So your solution works well if the starting point it outside of the polygon since the borders will catch any intersection. However, if the starting point is on the polygon itself and the ending point is also on the polygon, then the border will not necessarily catch an intersection. This would mean that a line was able to travel through the polygon when it should not have been allowed to do that."	polygon			
"Hmmm, now i understand perfectly what you mean  but is this steal means that line intersect polygon or just that polygon contains a line?"	polygon			
"I'm actually considering this solution at the moment as it seems to make sense in my head. I'm just imagining how this scenario plays out with a large amount of shapes. It seems like with each move from vertex to vertex, which is what my program will be doing, I would have to check every combination of points within each shape to see if it intersects with my path. I was looking for a more graceful solution, but if this is the best out there then I may have to play around with this suggestion."				
You check for intersection until you find one that does intersect. You can stop at that point. There are definitely ways to optimize this.	this

is there a way to do it without any libraries?				
with library it is much easier....and you don't have to handle any callbacks manually.				
but im using VSC and I don't know how to install libraries :( I'm new to Java Development	VSC			
To Amimul Ehsan Rahi what do you think?

"If you don't want to wait to manually catch an ,ArrayIndexOutOfBounds,, I would perdonally throw an ,IllegalArgumentException,, since you alreasy know the value range of which the argument should lie within"	IllegalArgumentException			
And I would not throw a RuntimeException in this case	RuntimeException			
To Leo That alone doesn't seem as if it would help much. Mind explaining why you would choose a different route than throwing a RuntimeException?	RuntimeException			
"To VinceEmigh just a matter of preference. Since he's building an API, IMO, declaring the exceptions would help to show how to use it."				
"This does not seem to do what he wants, as he is passing in arrays of values, wanting to ensure the values are legal (both values share the same length). This answer doesn't seem to be relevant, unless you don't mind adding some context to your answer, explaining how doing this solves his problem"	This			
"To VinceEmigh I disagree. He's clearly developing the API boundary now, since he talks about alternate designs (validation class, array length check). The problem he states is ""What I am trying to do is handling a case when the length of the is != length of name"". This design addresses that by ensuring that there are always the same number of elements in both Lists."

To Mihir what would be alternative of APIBridge.jar for reading inbox for s40 series mobile..?	APIBridge.jar			
"I have updated my answer To coders_zone, have you read it ?"				
"yes i do. so, the conclusion is, there is no way to access inbox in s40 mobile. am i right.. ??"	inbox			
yes you are right. there is no way..	way			
"yes, because in background APIBridge.jar file accesses the Internet Connection"				
"but, it creating a loop, for asking the permission for accessing the internet. I mean it asking the permission again and again in my mobile. How can i remove this...?? On the other hand, is it true that, this APIBridge.jar can not be used for the s40 series mobile.. ??"	s40			
"for permission, you need to sign your application to avoid those messages. I haven't use APIBridge Jar file on s40, so can't say, give me 30 minutes, i will check and confirm it back to you. you can come to my chat room for instant conversion."	APIBridge			
you cannot use Apibridge for s40. It is purely made for Symbian device only.	Apibridge			
"If an API isn't loaded and you attempt to use it, it won't work.  How do you want it to act differently to the way it does now?"				
"Because, the mod might load before the API."	API			
That can happen if you use a custom classloader. Again I don't see how that is different to how it behaves now.				
And what do you want it to do differently?				
"Wow, that's simple! Thanks!"	Thanks			
Just attempting to use the class or API will do the same thing.	API			
"That's what I was saying. But if you are not sure when the API will be called the first time, then put in a method on start up with the line of Thorbj酶rn Ravn Andersen's post and check for an ,Exception,."	saying			
Or you can just call the method and catch the Error produced.  I don't see the point myself.				
One general reason for testing without falling is to enable/disable menu entries without invoking functionality in the library.	library			
"Oh ok, so like using a try block?"	block			
"exactly! So when your program starts, you can either check explicitly for the availability of the API, or you could put your first parts of the initialization in a try鈥揷atch block and let the program exit ,gracefully, if a ,ClassNotFoundException, gets thrown."	initialization			
"See also my question ,here, if you are interested please."				
"I am sorry, your answer is ok for the original question. I had my own question in my mind and your answer didn't provide me needed information. But as I said your answer is right. Sorry again. +1 for the answer."				
Too late to edit. The answer was updated with that answer anyway. Thanks for the clarification!				
This documentation is self-contradictory as a matter of fact. Either it is unique or it is re-usable. I suppose it should say something like 'unique when created'?	'unique			
I think it makes sense as is :P	P			
"That says that the ID uniquely identifies the thread, but it does not say that it is impossible to have two different objects in memory reference the same thread."	ID			
The incrementing is an implementation detail.  It could conceivably be different in other versions of Java ... past or future.				
"Quite often I use my own interface extending ,Function, to get both. My rule is simple: ""would any function do or do I need a special one?""."	Function			
Thanks for your answer.	answer			
"What are you actually trying to achieve? Do something at regular intervals on the server, or actually make an HTTP request to your server periodically?"				
Have to do something at regular intervals on the server sir.				
"Then start forgetting about doing it with a servlet. A servlet's only goal is to serve HTTP requests. You don't want to deal with HTTP requests, here. All you want is to do something at regular intervals on your server. Look at ,docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent , and ,docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet "	servlet			
ok sir I lookup an above links. Idea to create an class containing timer. now doubt is how to declare that class in web.xml. To declare this class in servlet(web.xml) which one is better<load-on-startup> or <listener>.	<listener>			
"This answer by BalusC on a duplicate question, has more detailed information."	BalusC			
Thanks sir. but wat i actually want is call the method in server periodically to request or respond to client.				
"Yes you can very well do that. use ajax that could refresh a part of page. check out this sample ,avajava.com/tutorials/lessons "				
ok sir. Hope it helps. Is any tutorial or sample is there.				
To declare this class in servlet which one is better<load-on-startup> or <listener>.	<listener>			
"Never never never use ,Timer, in a Java EE application!"	Timer			
To BalusC sir: Why we dont want to use timer in java EE application?				
"See linked duplicate. In short: it doesn't fit in the ""lifetime long running"" nature of a Java EE application. E.g. if an exception is thrown within a timer thread, the timer is effectively dead. It basically won't run anymore until you restart the whole server. This just doesn't make sense."	Java			
What error do you get?				
"To assylias: please, see updated question"				
The documentation on this service is not very detailed - you should talk to Bloomberg directly and ask them for a list of filters that are available from the API.	API			
Thanks. Even the different YK_FILTER's are not documented in the blapi document. I was wondering how to do a currency YK until I found this.				
Thanks Laura!  Exactly what I was looking for.  Can you point me to the area in the documentation that speaks to reference expansion?				
I am giving a try to this but how to read multiple params keys & it values ?				
"Formparams I can use but not able to create an object for it, as I have lot of keys and values which I dont want to hard code."	it			
Where do you have it stored outside of the application? An excel/json/property file? you got to create a logic to read the outside file and convert to a map and use it later in the rest-assured call.				
"I am not sure how this is relevant, if you are using it within the code then doesn't matter. But if you want to return it to front end, then you must never use Model classes directly. Refer ,this Entity to DTO conversion, for reference."				
You can just simple call for your required fields of the object.	object			
"Okay, thank you! Where do I add the interface ? Into the class Person?"	Person			
To user3476509 wherever you want. I would prefer placing it near relevant Repository classes	Repository			
I got the error:  Could not write JSON: Failed to convert from type [java.lang.String] to type [long]	[java.lang.String]			
"To user3476509 try to use ,Long, instead of ,long,. Though I don't get why it's even being converted in JSON"	Long			
To user3476509 if it's solved you can Accept my answer				
"I would like to return the object Person, but with just the attributes id and email."	email			
"If you handle an instance of ,Person, it always has all of the fields. Whether these fields actually contain useful information is another matter. But you cannot strip fields from a class. See Nikolai's answer for an approach using a different structure."	Person			
This seems more like a normal non-SOAP-API that just returns something formatted with XML.	This			
This is a custom XML document; nothing to do with SOAP. Just parse it with your favorite XML parser.	SOAP

What would be the problem of overloading?	overloading			
"Both variants are good. As above said, if you add overlapping arguments a named approach would be better."				
"To Bob if you are programming against interfaces (i.e. Environment, Condition are interfaces), you will have problem when a class implement both interface. Plus it is harder to read the code."				
"Ah, that is true. Have not thought about that before but that makes sense. Thank you"	sense			
So you don't think the name is to long?	long			
"A method name should convey meaning.  If it requires a few extra characters to do that I feel its ok.  I get frustrated when I see method names kept intentionally short just to save a few keystrokes.  These names deviate from the main goal of a method name, which is to tell you what the heck the method does.  If your to lazy to press a few extra keys, you have bigger problems than the method name."				
"To Bob I wasn't calling you lazy.  I have just had experiences where developers have completely misrepresented the named of a method because it was easy to type.  For example one piece of code I looked at had a method named nice().  It ran some js that added styling to certain elements.  How are you supposed to know what nice() actually does by looking at a method call, especially in JS where intellisense is lacking in most ides"	nice()			
"To Bob I'd use ,get, prefix. Because what you do is getting records. ,all, can mean realy ,anything, - for example ""append argument to all records and return them""."	get			
You guys are making it hard for me to choose:)				
"Well, I hoped this one makes it more easy to choose. :)"				
"I see the benefits of both approaches, can't choose, ah life is hard!"	approaches			
Btw that what To user802421 said in his comment is what is meant by radically different types. Or when they are not radically different then it must not have to matter which overloaded method is executed. In fact this should be true when you name them the same.				
"I don't think it's a good way to do it,. Why isn't it a good way?"				
"The api should produce some JSON (application/json).  But the specification for this call is :  Object type:""string""    So i don't really know what i'm trying to do. I just want to know if there is a common practice."				
"see here ,stackoverflow.com/questions/7705081 , ""just looked into the JSON specification and from there it is written, that a value itself is not a valid JSON response (see ,json.org,)."""	JSON			
"My java is rusty so I might be way off base... but if map is a map of Integer's to Integer's, will your example even compile?"	Integer's			
"No, it won't compile.  The OP is confusing the compile time exception that would be thrown by the above example with a run time exception that is mentioned by the map API.  As To Affe has pointed out, the run time exception mentioned by the API should only be thrown if the new Map implementation has a special requirement that is not met (eg if the new Map requires a positive key and a negative key is specified)."

PIMPL is known and it also helps with compilation (no need to recompile all the source files that include the header every time that you add/remove/modify a private field declaration) but, well, it introduces an indirection level."

I searched a bit further and found this: ,stackoverflow.com/questions/16618037 ,  In that post, the rate limit also gets hit after a certain number of friends/followers/whatever.

"How big is that friends list, actually? If I look at this page (,dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits,), it seems you can make a request 15 times before being limited. Per request, you get 20 friends, so a maximum of 300 friends can be retrieved.  How weird/stupid would it be to actually having to wait until that rate limit is over and query the next x friends, if you have over a 300 friends?  ,edit, It seems it is that stupid. Found another person having problems with it: ,stackoverflow.com/questions/16174820/rate-limit-twitter-api"

If you forget that check (which will necessarily be more complicated than ""== null"") you pass the invalid object to a method that doesn't allow nulls and the error is potentinally sent way further down the call stack (and made more obscure). I'd strongly advise against empty objects (other than collections)."	empty-list-instead-of-null			
"When you're not sure if something ,could, return null, then the API is broken and must be fixed so you're sure it can return null. Then... when you're sure it can return null you document it by returning an Optional instead of a direct, nullable, object reference."				
"I was not talking about in the case of not knowing what an API method could return, but rather, in the case of having possible values passed to a method that will return null. Consider having a List<X> containing 'null' at index 4, and you call list.get(4), returning a null value for data you might've expected to be non-null. In this case, you would require a null-check because you're not sure if the method will return null. It doesn't imply a broken method; it implies an unexpected error that should be accounted for. Using an Optional, or anything similar, would be effectively the same."	list.get(4)

"While mapping HTTP operations to simple CRUD operations might sound like a good idea, HTTP operations in genearal are to general to support such a mapping blindly. I.e. ,DELETE, only gurantees that the connection between the URL and the resource is removed but leaves the client clueless whether the server also removes the data belonging to the resource as well. A client in general is usually not interested in such internal decisions anyway as long as the resource state isn't retrievable any longer."	HTTP			
"Further, the spec leaves room for interpretation. DELETE i.e. only states that certain response codes should be returned if the operation actually removed something but not what should happen if i.e. the resource was not available at all. Here it is more or less individual preference. All a client wants is that a certain URI shouldn't return a resource's state after the invocation. A 404 tells the client the the resource didn't exist before while a 200 response informs a client that no representation for the requeted URI is available any further. ..."	i.e			
"... The effect, however, are pretty similar that invoking the URL doesn't return any resource's state further. It is therefore more or less an implementation detail not that important to clients"	URL

Why are you using primitive arrays instead of lists? Just curious	lists			
"Primitive arrays are lots faster and more memory-efficient (think of operations on huge number matrices) ;)     But to be able to generalize certain functionality, I also need boxed arrays."

"Yes, it would be probably similarly fast, but not as memory efficient: boxed types are objects, each one of them has an overhead (compared to primitive types). Also, think of garbage collection: what is faster, freeing a fixed primitive array, or millions of objects? ,(I would guess, it's quite a difference)."

"Thanks for your reply To desertnaut . Yes, I am little confused about how exactly I can calculate TPR and FPR for different threshold values. I am not using default evaluation functions to generate ROC, I want to calculate TPR and FPR for each threshold point using TP, FP, FN, TN. I want to calculate  TPR and FPR like as precision and recall using Java Code (see Source Code)."	TPR			
"ROC is pointless with classification methods, as the decision has already been made by the algorithm and there is no threshold to vary any longer. You need to get access to the class probabilities or some raw, quantitative score. I don't know how you'd do that with weka. Maybe try to find a regression algorithm instead."	probabilities

"One possibility is that you may have access to some, but not all region servers. If your logs aren't detailed enough (which probably by default they aren't) you might not be seeing these errors. So maybe your client can access the Master, but not all RS? Just something to triple-check..."				
How would I fix this if that was the case?				
"That could be anybody's guess. My best guess would be host name resolution? Try accessing all your RS via telnet on the right port from your client machine. If that works then the issue is somewhere else. If it doesn't that's what you have to fix first. Always try to communicate with HBase via host names, not IP addresses."

Java is a very old language that has gone through many iterations and they try like hell to be backward compatible. This is akin to Python < 3.0.

"the ,setName(), method can check the name or you can add the ,checkName() ,method to the People class. would that help?"				
"Thanks, or should I just use the interface and let it implement the interface, but remove the static from all checking method. So, if others want to use my API, they just instantiate the interface, and use instance.checkName() to call method ? is that a good way ?"	interface			
"Shouldn't the object itself be self validating?  That's kind of the point of OO.  A procedural language would have functions for validating other ""structures"", but an OO language should focus on self contained units of work - IMHO. Not to say you wouldn't have business logic that wouldn't do extra checking though"				
"Thanks very much for your elaborated and useful feedback. I actually know how the people class is going to be checked.  but just the people class may be changed and I also need to make some change on my checking function. But, I know how the people class is going to change and how I should change my check function.  The consumer of my checking function dont need to change their code for existing checking function like check name, and they need to add new function call for newly added checking function like checkingAddress.  Yes, I should make the ppl class final cause I just read it not write"	ppl			
"For the case is like the comment above, should I still use this registering way to build this API  ? or static method.  How about making all checking funcion the public (non static) method, and define an interface including all these checking function. caller just need to instantiate this interface (e.g., checkingfunctions), and call the function like:   checkingfunctions.checkName(ppl);  is this also feasible ?  For this interface one and class including static methods, which one is recommended ? Thanks"				
"If only you alone ever need to change the checking function but your users are never supposed to change them, then I would definitely use public static methods for these functions. But if somehow possible, I'd consider adding a single default checking method instead of multiple ones. E.g. just ,public static check(People),. This default method could then call the more specific functions like ,checkName,, ,checkAddress, etc. as appropriate. This way your users would perhaps not need to change their code each time you add a new checking function to your code."	checkName			
I wouldn't provide an interface to the public api if you know that there is only ever going to be a single class that extends this interface...				
"Thanks, yes, that is what I did. I create a method call checkPeople including all related method like checkName, checkAge. but the caller told me they also need to access some specific method like checkName individually. Thus, it need to open all checking methods to them. I can use the static method.  BTW, I am the only owner of this checking service and no one else can change it."				
"Mmph, I was asking more about how specifically you use the key in your youtube player. I've never used a server key before, but when I last got the FileNotFound error using an Android key, it was because I'd mixed up where to put the video id vs the api key. That obviously might not be your problem, but it's hard to tell what's going on without seeing how you're using the key."	key			
"Well I am not having a problem with the YouTube Player, just parsing the JSON from a call to the Search list method.  So I am making a request to ,https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?part=snippet........&key=MyAPIKey, and parsing the results."				
"Ahh. Okay. I've never done a direct youtube call from Android using the API, and to some extent I wonder if it's even possible. As far as I know, when it comes to using Youtube on Android, you've got two options. One (recommended!) you use the YoutubePlayer API, which is super easy to use, or two, you use the RTSP link, parse the JSON, and get a (usually really crappy quality) video. ,This, is a decent example of how to implement the former."

When OnConnected is called? And when you are sending the request?    I can tell you first you're sending... And onConnected is called after that...	And			
When should I use the .connect() method? I want to set the variable values to the values returned in the onConnected() method.	connect()			
"I followed the documentation on the Android Dev site... and they gave me the code to assign the TextViews in the onConnected() method. I figured I'd assign the variables their values there. Now, I'm seeing that the values set in the onConnected() method don't carry over to the rest of the app. How would I assign the coordinate values then?"

"There are many ways to consume RESTful APIs - typically, you need to know what version of the API you are going to use.  When the API changes (ie. a different version is exposed) you need to decide if the new functionality is worth migrating your application(s) to the latest and greatest or not... It always requires some effort to migrate to new APIs"				
"To ochi that could be an answer, adding the fact that WHEN there is different API versions to use. I have seen companies that just change without let the old one available. I know, terrible but it happens"	use			
"To JorgeCampos definitely happens; I've seen it too... serious companies with interests in keeping their consumers happy know not to do that :) - even then, eventually they might drop support for old/deprecated APIs (with enough warning, communication to the consumers, of course) - per your suggestion, adding it as an answer"	course)			
"Yeah, those are the steps I would use assuming a Java API was not provided."	Java			
thanks Robert. I have one more question. So let say I have a Java web application. Then I want to consume APIs from Weather.com to integrate weather info into my app. From my understanding I can consume it in 2 ways: 1) Using Javascript to call the API and display result in the browser 2) Call API on the server side (my app's server side) and then send result to my app's client (ie: browser)  Is this correct?	API			
"I'm not familiar with weather.com's API, but both of those solutions seem viable to me."	weather.com's			
"HI Ochi. Can you be more specific about ""many ways"". For each way, can you list out the steps like I do. Thanks"	many			
"To hdang the steps you listed are correct.  Overall, if you want to manipulate the response in Java, you would need to map them to your Employee entity.  However, imagine that if your JSON response is flat (i.e. only key/value pairs) you may not want to bother with an Employee entity and instead use a Map.  Or if your JSON response is mostly an array of flat objects you can create an array of Map objects.  Using GSON (or similar) is the way to go for most cases"				
"Also consider if you need to map them in Java at all - if they are going to be displayed in the UI only, why not pass the JSON response directly to the UI and let JS do the sorting/mapping - Yes, you need to adjust your UI/JS accordingly every time the JSON format changes but your Java side of things will remain the same."				
Thanks Ochi. These explanations helps	These			
To hdang I am glad I could help				
how to input a JSON object and response like you test. I'm interesting that.	JSON

To user3117619 Great - that is useful to know. Thanks!				
I don't follow.  Do you control these classes?  Why can't you just make them not public?				
"Yes, but I'm using them from other packages in my project for instance org.sirix.axis, org.sirix.axis.filter, org.sirix.access, org.sirix.node, org.sirix.api (for the public api) and other packages/classes. in org.sirix.access.NodeReadTrxImpl which implements org.sirix.api.NodeReadTrx I'm also using the nodes from package org.sirix.node. Or did I miss something? At least it shouldn't be possible to provide an access modifier other than public in these cases."				
Isn't that what I'm doing by adding the key to the API call in my provideOkhttpClient() method which injects the Okhttp instance? Or are you talking about creating another method in my Netmodule class just to inject the key? The key will always be the same.	Okhttp			
"In principle, the transaction mechanism is designed for this purpose. What further requirements you have that you consider transaction rollback as  ,unpleasant side effects in the DB, ?"				
"Yeah, the problem is that different DBs have different behaviour for such kind of events. In my case I got some kind of blocking because of complex replication structure. I generally don't want to catch and receive any kind of such exceptions from the DB, I want to prevent their appearance."				
I am right or wrong. I don't know as per my knowledge we can do one thing just check the data is available in db or not like getFooById(id); if you get the data than you can delete same data otherwise you can throw the exception that data is not there	wrong			
"The problem that this approach doesn't cover my current hassles. Several multiple requests of DELETE of same raw in heavy loaded DB causes kind of blocking, so all this multiple requests fail with 504 timeout error. Certainly all delete methods themself  are performed in transactional level. But it doesn't cover case when DB itself behaves in improper way."				
"504 timeout error on delete requests is generaly a symptom of not being able to get a (pessimistic) lock. But this a the hard part of optimizing the database accesses and it heavily depends on the database itself and the major use cases. I'm sorry, but I am afraid I cannot say much more. Maybe you could try to replace pessimistic locks with optimistic ones to exchange 504 timeout errors with messages like ,System was busy and could not complete your request, please try again.."				
"That's not suitable. As I wrote in my question, the direct way will be introduce synchronisation on particular entities's ids. This will simply prevent DB from being locked, so it will be no any hassles with timeout exceptions - sequentially executed DELETE methods will quickly return OK, as deleting of an absent entity in my API is legal operation. My question was about: is it possible or not, use existent capabilities of Spring MVC framework to do the same trick on more higher level."	synchronisation

You can't tell a server you are sending json and expect it to be able to parse something that is not json. A 400 is a step in the right direction. It tells you your request body is either missing something or not formatted correctly.  It might help if you read the response body.	json

How can I change the setting of the repository such that no one else is allowed to update the code?.....You mean having private repo??	repo			
"To Arivazhagan no, it could be public. But you can define who contributes to the project. If you do not allow any one else as a contributor to the project, then no one would be able to commit any changes in the main repository. They could still fork a public repository and make changes in their local machine. But since there are not allowed to merge their changes to the main repository it will not go to production. If you want no one to see your code, then you need to make it private."	project

"HAL is just one format. The objective is to be able to discover/navigate the API through links. So it doesn't have to be in the HAL format, as long as you can fulfill the objective. I personally don't like the HAL format, but I do find having links to related objects very beneficial."	API			
"To PaulSamsotha, I agree with you, HAL is not a must and is often a matter of taste, but in case of HATEOAS is it necessary for a private API with a single and defined client(for now)? Are there any benefits other than depriving the front-end client of having to build links to access specific endpoints? As we can verbally communicate about which endpoint to access for specific actions."

"You should apply REST principles whenever you don't want server changes to break clients. REST is just a generalization of the Web where browsers remain stable whenever a server changes i.e. URIs of certain resources or adds new content. When you don't need such properties (i.e. your server and client always changes together and there is only ever one version available) then just don't go for the REST-train, but don't fall into the marketing trap and simply don't call it REST API/client then"	REST			
"If you think about how the Web evolved to its current state you might agree that its success was probably provided due to its robustness and its freedom it gave to webservers providing web content. Besides HTML pages a ton of additional content is exchanged, like images, videos and what not. Plenty of features where added over the years through extensions or plugins. Instead of a browser expecting a certain link to return a PNG image, the client tells the sever what format it is capable of and the server will provide (ideally) a representation the client understands."	Web			
"This is exactly what REST tries to provide to other application than the browser based Web. Most of the so called REST APIs out there are RPC just with a marketing label ""REST"" put on them. I don't think that aiming for REST is therefore a shot into ones own foot. I rather try to see the meaning into exposing the DB layer through an additional model layer and convert that to JSON through CRUD operations instead of directly exposing the DB itself, especially for an internal application. Plenty of stuff is already provided by DB, like views or user restrictions."	REST			
"ERP systems usually understand different formats. Some of them are standardized like ,application/edifact, some others follow a custom specification or XML/CSV dialect. Currently the API dictates which formats (and which fields) a client receives when it would be more benefitial if the client would just send the media-types it knows how to process and the API would return those. Also, link relations and their accompanying URIs could be utilized to guide clients into up- or downloading documents and retrieve their state or geneate an archive of the past month."				
"The point I'm trying to make clear is, you can't forsee the future and even an internal API/tool might get public over the years. If you are in a situation where you have plenty of clients using your API (internal or external doesn't matter really) and you need to change something you have basically 3 options. If you already have a REST architecture you should be fine otherwise you either need to patch the changes somehow into your application or redesign it from scratch. Option 2 (patch), however, leads to either a hard to use API or hard to maintain code (or both) over the years"

I took a quick look. With JOOQ what happens to the autogenerated Java classes when the database schema changes?	autogenerated

"Adding fields is what I'd consider a ,compatible change,. Hence, you don't need to re-generate anything. Those fields will just not be selected."	compatible			
"Are you running a 32 bit or 64 bit JVM ? (32 bit application cannot address more than 2Gb ram on windows and some of those 2Gb is needed by the runtime, libraries, etc.)"

"On 32-bit windows, the limit is closer to 1.3 GB of memory. (You will find a similar limit if you run excel on a large spreadsheet) If you need to access more memory in a single application, you need a 64-bit OS. 32-bit Java on 64-bit OSes can access up to 3 GB, but you are likely to be better off using the 64-bit JVM in that case."	64-bit			
Which version of Windows is this on? You're going to struggle if this is still a 32-bit MSFT OS.	Windows			
I'm running a 32bit jvm. Have you then a suggestion about the way to use this api which needs at least 2GB ?	32bit

Even prototype-based languages usually don't have multiple copies of the same method floating around. Objects normally share the methods of their parents.

Which version of Notes are you using. We just got a similar error in our client code that talks to Notes. We have not gotten this error in 6.5.1 all the way up to 8.5.1. We did get this in 8.5.2 and am wondering if it has something to do with that version of Notes. We are still using the 6.5.1 API jar to talk to Notes and haven't had any issues with it until now.				
"We had an issue where some Java code which was relying on Notes.jar to  run and was working fine on our machines with all Notes versions going back to early versions of LN7.

Notice that you don't have to thinks like this any more. Take a look at libraries like HtmlUnit and the usage of XPath queries to avoid painful iterations like the ones we are doing here.	XPath			
"So you want developers generate some HTML pages that contain reports? You might just use plain JSP along with HTML code completion and syntax highlighing within Eclipse (I'd say other major IDEs support that as well) - which also tells you whether you are missing a closing tag etc. To me it seems that with ECS you'd still have to have some knowledge of HTML and CSS, otherwise you'd not know what elements/styles to employ."	JSP			
"Yes, velocity and freemarker are dwefinitely a better choice, but unfortunately I'm not aware of any editor that supports completion/highlighting for html as well as velocity/freemarker. However, speaking of Eclipse, you might be able to use them and open the files in an HTML/JSP editor - which does provide HTML code completion etc. but lacks velocity/freemarker support - and first create the HTML parts. Then you could switch the editor to fill in velocity/freemarker specific parts."	freemarker			
"Intellij has a good support for at least freemarker. I'm just not very familiar with it yet and I'm still looking for the solution I want to adopt. I like template engine for very simple task, but once there is a lot of logic, I don't feel them very readable and maintanable."	Intellij			
"why should I ""Don't bother with object models for generating HTML."" ? GWT and other components based client API are successfully bothering with it :-)"	GWT			
"GWT, JSF, and the like synchronise state between the browser and the server, so they needs some kind of mapping between the DOM and the component model.  You are only generating reports in one direction (if I understood correctly).  I think it's an extra effort to build a tree just for that, and it's not worth it.  Templates are easier."	JSF			
"Very true. The thing I'm not comfortable with using template (and JSP) is that it can become quite a mess when there is too much logic in it. Then I can introduce a 'presentation model' to avoid complex templates, but this is extra effort too. The other thing I don't like is the maintenance problem arising when the object model change."

Why don't each user set use different classes? Then you can encapsulate the semantics better? In other words why only one API? Why not provide 3 APIs?				
"Create three interfaces and have a function that returns the appropriate ""level"" of interface?  This does have precedence in, say, COM; an object can present any number of interfaces, and you query for the interface you want."				
"Why don't you check the ,""level"", of the user in a single method and return appropriate result?"				
yeah. let all user access all the methods and throw an error if they are not authorized	yeah			
"To noti: Hardly.  You have one class masquerading as three.  Any time one of the three fake classes changes, that means changing the one real class.  What happens if those changes start interfering with each other?  Better to have an underlying type present one clear set of universal operations, IMO, and then split the level-specific functionality off into decorators (that can then be changed without changing the main class and potentially breaking the other decorators)."				
"Very important question. Who is using this API? Are they literally writing code to use this api? Unless you specifically say ""This code handles different user levels"" tell the person who uses your api that THEY need to handle user access levels."				
"Is there a reason you aren't using a tool like Jackson, which can serialize to both formats?"	Jackson			
"Ah, I see. Read too fast. The question is when to do validation, before or after unmarshalling. I guess I don't see the downside to #2. How is robustness/reliability affected by validating the DTO instead of the JSON/XML? You're creating one cheap object and then either throwing it out right away or using it for the rest of the request. I think you run a significant risk of the schema getting out of synch. And I don't think there are any other solutions - you have to validate, and it can be before or after unmarshaling."				
I guess there is always a risk about creating objects containing non-validated user provided input. For example it might make the app more vulnerable to DoS attacks. to E.g. someone would start creating requests containing huge values that would either cause overflow or memory leak.	input

"10.4.5 404 Not Found  The server has not found anything matching the Request-URI. No indication is given of whether the condition is temporary or permanent. The 410 (Gone) status code SHOULD be used if the server knows, through some internally configurable mechanism, that an old resource is permanently unavailable and has no forwarding address. This status code is commonly used when the server does not wish to reveal exactly why the request has been refused, or when no other response is applicable."				
This is from w3.org. I would think that since the resource is not there the api should return 404				
If you are doing PURE REST implementation then you should return 404. Be it wrong uri or resource (event) doesn't exist. In any case it should be 404.	PURE

"I know this is an old thread, but I'm here because I'm trying to figure out how to deal with supporting side-by-side versions of an API.

My app needs to support integration to whichever version a client has in their environment, so I think I need to treat the version as a configuration option and provide some kind of switch to varying underlying logic.

See my answer for what I'd suggest...	suggest			
"wouldn't that attact people to instead use using statements like  using SDK.CompanyNameLibrary?  And I imagine most if not all of the classes in that namespace should be internal or private, so as to limit confusion when importing the dll...  any and all help appreciated"	SDK.CompanyNameLibrary			
"Not really. If you're working with any kind of large-scale system, eventually you're going to have a multitude of namespaces to work with. I feel that the best way to deal with this is to choose your namespaces intelligently in such a way that they accurately reflect what they contain. SDK.CompanyNameLibrary.CompanyInternalAPI tells the implementer that they are getting the company's internal API for whatever library they are using. Although I would probably drop the SDK as it isn't really necessary."	SDK			
"So put everything into one namespace, and simply make things internal / public?  That means I'm going to have ~hundred classes all in one folder in the project, only maybe 25-30 of which are going to be marked public.  Is that really a good practice?  Seems hard to organize..."				
"Right, I figured one namespace for the public facing materials, and one for the implementation, which is the bulk of the work.  Also, that should have said ~100, not several hundred, apologies"				
"Even 100 suggests you should be able to break it down more sensibly. If these are meant to be replacements or enhancements to the normal BCL, I'd take the cue from that - so for example, a stream helper class could be in ,CompanyName.BclPlusPlus.IO, to match ,System.IO,."

"Thanks! I thought about the first solution but it looked just wrong... The second one is tricky though, can you explain to me what does this annotation means? And thanks again for the fast response."				
"Arguments to an API method, by default, appear in the body (and are expected to be Java Beans). Named arguments appear in the query string (as a key/value pair), so they need a name like ""d"" and should be scalar types instead of Beans."				
"So I understand that the string inside the annotation would be the name of the parameter the would be displayed on the client-side, and the ""Double d"" is the type and name just used for the method itself?"	annotation			
Correct. It's treated as a normal method argument aside from the annotation.

"The Java part of a JNI Library is the same on every platform, but the native code part has to be compiled separately for every platform you support.

Thank you ! I knew it would have been something like that. But where to find the tools and guides to accomplish this much ? I need a stand-alone library. The code will most certainly be obfuscated (meaning external developpers should not be able to have access). So how should I create this API ? Can I use Netbeans IDE and create a C/C++ Library ?

"From my experience I used Eclipse, and the problem is that the entry point is in java, so the debuggers must switch (there's a java debugger and a native debugger), and in Eclipse this was working very badly (more like it wasn't working). Notepad++ doesn't come with debuggers, I said that I preferred using Notepad++ rather then using Eclipse with C++ (auto-complete didn't work well, notepad++ is more lightweight,etc). You won't end up pasting code. You will have a C++ entry point when you are debugging on desktop and a Java entry point when you're testing on the real thing."				
"I dislike Eclipse. I just tried Netbeans C++ debugger (that uses gdb of course) and it works fine. Autocompletion to. Anyway, where should I write this C++ wrapper (the entry point) ? How come the debugger will be attached to the code ? Thanks for the help !"

"No problem.What I am saying is that if you use the url to version and you roll out a new version, your clients do NOT have to change (provided you are supporting your previous version).Because the url goes from /v1/products (which is being used and still supported) to /v2/products, that means that people using the /v1/products will be unaffected by the new version you introduce for /v2/products. Now this is only true, of course, if the code you write for your version 2 does not cause version 1 to break.  How do you manage multiple versions of an API is a much broader (and trickier) of a topic"	/v1/products			
"To  Jerrod Hortan my point is cleared now ,but one thing i want to know is when we introduce  new version it means that there well be separate class for it to support new version with new version signature ?? If yes it means that if you have 5 different versions than there will be 5 different classes  for it ?"				
"Yes.  In my experience it is best to not only have 5 different classes for 5 different versions but, sometimes, it is even good to have completely separate projects for them.  The risk you run of having them all in the same project is that you might accidentally change something on a previous version without meaning to because of something you needed to add for a current version.  However, I would say to keep them in different classes at the very least."	them

"This may be overkill, but as the application grows it can be easier to manage the code base with multiple projects. For example, each functional layer of the app is in its own project. This can include the util classes in its own project, where the util.jar simply becomes a dependency by the other projects which need it.

"Thanks To Chase. I'm curious though, is this the only way Java allows this to happen, that is, you must read all lines and then choose which to actually use in your program?"	Java			
"Pretty much. Any any language you have to read the contents in before you can access it. You could skip over data until you run into a ,\n, character. But that wouldn't be any less complicated.

"Well this servlet is actually within a portlet, I'm using ,PortalDelegateServlet, to publish the servlet within the portal context. Maybe I'm missing something pretty obvious?"				
"No need to go cross-context here. Just write a standard, classic portlet, e.g. an action- or resource handler and move the code there. If you use the resource-serving phase, this comes closest to a servlet. From that portlet you have all the portal/portlet context readily available and don't need to care getting everything you need. ,UserLocalServiceUtil, is also available."				
"hey there Olaf, thanks a lot for your help. Quick question thou, and this is where my requirement starts getting a bit weird. The reason I went for a servlet is because it could be accessed from the outside trough a public URL. Now if I go for a ,serve resource,, is there a way to access this method trough a public URL? Just as you can with a servlet? Thanks man."	servlet			
"well, yes you can. The only thing is that - in the portal world - the URL is generated for you by the portal. It might look ugly. However, that shouldn't be anything to keep you from it: You can implement a redirect/url-rewrite in Apache, offering a pretty URL on Apache that is forwarded to an ugly portal URL. Or you can implement FriendlyURLs if you want to stay in the portal world. There are Liferay APIs for this. Apache mod_rewrite is probably the easiest/quickest way though - a bit hackish, but very quick"	redirect/url-rewrite

Add the code that you are using to insert the image if you want somebody to help.				
Have you read what I wrote? I ask how to replace image. This doesn't have anything to do with inserting image. If you have document (for example odt) and in this documents are graphic objects with links (not embedded) then the question is: how to make this linked objects to be embedded? I think there is no need to place code for insterting any images (in fact this is done by LibreOffice transparently - I don't instert images from code).	inserting			
"Ok, lets try again. I don't know if you understand me. I know how to insert images via openoffice/libreoffice java API. This is not the case. In odt, doc, docx formats you can have pictures storing in two ways: embedded images in odt/doc/docx file or only like links (e.g. http links, file links). The problem is this: I have odt file with pictures which have links to real data (not embedded in odt file). Now I want to make some oprations which will make this pictures embedded. I ask if you know the code for that. The code for inserting images, which I can paste here, is not necessary here."

I would suggest to track the process in some in-memory cache.

"It would be up to the person who downloaded the source to use their own API key to make it work.

"I was considering if moving the ,createInstance(), as part of the interface declaration a good design approach or not. I would only define the method and not the actual implementation"	createInstance()			
Adding a abstract method in the interface to create a new instance assumes that the interface knows the constraints implementations (such as the required fields)  and it is not a good idea either because it couples the interface to the implementation. Only the reverse should be true.

"To Tom: that's what I said didn't I?  (I can see that a dedicated thread might give better throughput ... if the application is I/O bound, but you'd get the same effect by increasing the number of worker threads creating the stuff to be written.)"				
"To Stephen: No. You said one synchronized method call. Tom pointed out it is possible to queue file entries. OP doesn't ask for high-performance, just for concurrency-compatibility."				
"That solution has terrible performance impact. As I understand it, Romam wants to write chunks of characters in one stream, not multiple entries..."				
To Viliam: it is not possible to know what the OP really wants.  I suppose it is possible that he/she sants to write multiple chunks into a single ZIP file entry.  But then the answer is the same as for any output stream or writer ... and why would he/she bother with a ZIP stream rather than a plain stream or a stream with better compression.				
To Viliam: your first solution won't work.  You need to do the putNextEntry/write(s)/closeEntry in a single synchronized call.	putNextEntry/write(s)/closeEntry			
To Stephen C: No. Romam needs to write chunks of characters asynchronously. Not multiple files. Putting putNextEntry/write(s)/closeEntry into a single sync block would ruin that completely.	putNextEntry/write(s)/closeEntry			
To Viliam: OK ... so that is a plausible interpretation of the question.  But I really don't think that is what he/she means.  Why would he/she be using a ZIP stream rather than (say) a plain stream or a stream with a better compression algorithm?	question			
"To Stephen C: That's because the question has been changed! :) The first version asks explicitly to use ZipOutputStream, this one (edited after the answer I post) is only about OutputStream. That's live I guess..."	ZipOutputStream

Are you sure that the listener you provide as parameter has the type Listener that you declared and not another Listener implementation existing in the class path (check your imports)?	imports)			
"To Eyal, no. It's not the same Listener. This is the point. My ,addListener, method takes ,Listener,s from my interface and I want to give to the ,addListener, and instance of the Listener class declared in the external software."				
"But Listener will be provide by an external class (which I do not write). So, I cannot force Listener class to implement my interface. I have no control over the Listener class from the ""external"" code."	Listener			
"In any case, your ""Listener"" parameter and the 3-rd part listener that is actually past in the function must be of the same ""type"" in order to be accepted by the VM. So either you declare a 3rd part interface as parameter (and you need to add the 3rd part library to your project build path) or you declare you're interface and then 3rd part developer will have to implement it to work in your application..."

Why not load the info in the background so the rest of the app can be used during loading?"	ProgressBar			
To ElliottFrisch - What do you mean by combining them? Can you elaborate it or set an axample? Thanks.	them			
To JustinPollard - I haven't tried google's volley library but I will look into it. I used the progress bar since the functionality of the apps depends on the data being retrieved. So if I make them cancelable and put it to background the app won't have any functionality at all. And the user might be surprised that something just popped up after the data was loaded on background				
"I see, I see. Another option that is, in my opinion, a little less jarring to the user is displaying a ProgressBar rather than ProgressDialog. I'm just personally not a fan of something so obstructive as the ProgressDialog. Yea, I'd strongly suggest looking into Volley, which optimizes for various types of API calls and uses the correct http stack based on what's available."	is

Oh yea that is nice. Is there a simple way for me to also make it grey and not show the animation of being pressed inside when I click on it?				
"I don't think it's possible or at least not straightforward. You can remove all title bar stuff using setUndecorated() but that probably is no good to you. Maybe you also need to look into your use case, WHY do you need a window that is not closable? What method should the user use if they ever wish to close it? It doesn't seem like good UI design..."	setUndecorated()			
"An example of a more standard approach to UI design for what you want is: when certain conditions are met, if the user presses close button show a message (dialog box or something like that) informing them that until those conditions are met you can't close the window. (and possibly give them an option to close it anyway if they want to)"	UI			
I am mostly experimenting with it. I want to use it in situations like the following: The jframe is showing a progress bar and as long as the progress bar is not full I want the x button to turn grey and unusable and stay this way until the bar fills up. Sending out a message and requiring of the user to press another button to get rid of it isn't so nice when you can just disable the button. The user will understand the same things the message would tell them.	following			
"You can also use a JWindow instead in this case, it doesn't have those buttons by default..."	JWindow

"Ah, OK. I don't think it's possible using a JFrame."	JFrame			
Could I achieve this using something different? Even if I have to use something else instead of swing?				
"You could make the frame undecorated and provide your own decorations, or you could ask the look and feel to provide the decorations for you and hack it to make it display a grey button for your JFrame subclass, if some ""closable"" property is false.

Use Java generics to solve this	generics			
"Just be careful about over-engineering this.  Clients use your library; events happen; there are data associated with those events.  All you need to do is define an interface that passes the client that event data and let them define the implementation they need.  Then allow the client to register for the event.  In that sense, To CodeLionX 's answer is a little more accurate for your situation.  IMHO, using a string to determine an action is not as clear as a specific interface method for that action."	over-engineering			
"Not without getting into reflection and annotations, which you've ruled out.  Besides, those techniques add a lot of complexity and risk of defects on your part for a small benefit on the client's part.  Registering implementation instances are a pretty standard thing in Java and Android.  I don't think it's unreasonable to require an API client to add a couple extra lines of code on their side in order to get the benefit of your API."	Java

"Thanks a lot for helping me out.  I think I understand after dwelling on it for a little while.  I think I need to read more about how sparkjava is delivering the http responses.  I think what you're getting at is that in my GET method, it is returning a string, in this case JSON formatted, but by simply returning a string, it is giving a 200 HTTP response, but the msg is error.  If the user isn't authenticated, I issue a ,halt(401, ""{\""error\"":\""Please Authenticate.\""}"");,.  This way is probably more accurate, since I give an error code, then my custom message."	sparkjava			
"To jeffery_the_wind My advice is: stick to the standards and return the most appropriate HTTP code for each situation. For example, don't return a ,200 OK, when you are requesting a resource that doesn't  exist; a ,404 Not Found , is much better. Don't return a ,200 OK, if the authenticated user has no permission to access a resource; a ,403 Forbidden, is the right response for this situation. Along with the ,4xx, status codes, you can return a descriptive message or the error. It will help the client to understand what was wrong with the request."

"I accept that argument for widening values for the primitives, but providing an interface that accepts ,Number,s and a ,String, is misleading. I would point out the ambiguity of how far will the internal processing go to finding the right answer for you (e.g., will it parse hex numbers)? And, more importantly, why on Earth should such an interface be held to the whims of what boils down to input. The provider of that data should know its format, and it should be validated where it comes in so that it can be corrected closest to the problem. A conversion framework could be stood up in parallel."				
"To pickypg ""will it parse hex numbers?"" -- You've missed the point of the principle.  The point being that in the future it would have the capacity to without a signature change.  I agree with your point, keep your contract tight, and call a spade a spade, but I can't count on one hand how many times I've had to retrofit code to accommodate a document ID, an invoice number, a serial number or similar that was ,supposed, to be an integer for all eternity to something alphanumeric."	principle			
"To jonathan.cone I didn't miss the point so much as disagree with it. Rather than having a bunch of do-nothing methods, or at the very least unpredictable ones, I'd much rather have the tight contract. After all, if you need to convert it to fit the contract, then you can write an adapter. If you need to completely change the meaning of the interface, then the meaning of the API has changed anyway, and changes should be acceptable. Anything more is really just over engineered."	it			
"Yes, the debate sounds funny to me, because we are in a strongly type environment, yet people want to weasel their way around that type system. I would err on the side of keeping the type checking too. And isolating the conversion functionality, if any, as you suggest."	me

"It might be not clear in the question but my semantics need to be accessed remotely. Hence, ""...Providing a remotely accessible API over REST is completely orthogonal to your concern ..."" is not accurate. Do you have any specific suggestion or just a general statement about ""just put a layer of abstraction..."" which does not contribute much (IMO)?"				
"I would suggest forming the question more clearly and in greater detail if you want a specific answer. What is the API's purpose? Who are its consumers? For example, if the API needs to cater to varying types of clients, I would choose REST. If all clients are Java, and I'm willing to lock myself in and deal with the pain of re bundling binaries for clients when I change the API, I could opt for Java RMI. These choices are contextual and must be taken carefully. I gave a general suggestion to nudge you in the right direction and get you thinking about the problem."	REST

"To JamesBlack You see, I am making a server software, which developers can hook the jar into the class path to have access to the functions and develop a plugin, which changes the behavior of the software without having to change the actual code of it.

"yes, that's possible as well. But, what if I have say different results from that single method, which could be obtained by simply calling getResultPrimary(), getResultSecondary()."	getResultPrimary()			
"I think, I didn't word my question correctly. No this is not a problem of sync or async. It is more of a API design question - How would structure your code/API?"				
"Yes, I think your update is more relevant to my question. The downside of having a single method is, that this single method would have to effectively return the output. But let's just say that there are multiple outputs. So for instance, my algorithm is probably creating two lists. Your suggestion would require me to create a class that will hide these two lists and my method would have to return an instance of this class. Well, now if you think about it, this return class is anemic in nature. It is serving as an empty container. Not quite useful? Reminds me of the anemic VO/DTO pattern."	It			
"Well, sadly Java lacks a ""Pair"" or ""Tuple"" class, which makes returning 2 values always a bit odd. Still, if the ,end, result is 2 values, that's what you should return (in a ,Collection, for example, that way it's not locked into just 2 values). If the logic works so, that the first value is calculated in ,method1(), and the second one in ,method3(), (hypothetical parts of your algorithm), then there might be a different way about it, but not necessarily any better."	Java			
"Ok, lets say, they are not return types of same data type? One is a String another is a List."				
Then that's already a complex enough data type to warrant its own class. I mean classes are cheap and they just make the code more easy to understand.				
what if doExecuteMySpecialAlgorithm throws an exception which I expect the caller to handle? it wouldn't really look nice if all your getResult methods also throw this exception up?	doExecuteMySpecialAlgorithm

"To Java1 Yes. You were not allowed to declare ,static, methods on interfaces in Java 7 (nor default methods in fact)."

To Java1: In a static interface method you can call other static interface methods as well!	well

This error message: ""Missing URI template variable 'courseId' ..."" for the path: ""/topics/1/courses/1/marks"" tells us that Spring was unable to populate the ,courseId, parameter of ,MarksController.getAllMarks,. The reason for this is that the annotation on that method does not declare ,{courseId}, instead it declares ,{id},.

"Note that this method just flags the document for encryption. Once it is flagged, encryption is automatic when you save with the current id file, and decryption is automatic when you open with it.  Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption. (The reason being that a signature does not give the agent access to fhe id file conttainging the key pair.)"	decryption			
"Ah, it's starting to come back to me... The documentation for this method is talking about using secret encryption keys, not public/private key pairs - but you can do it. I wrote an article about this many years ago. I can't find a link to its original location on notes.net, but fortunately, it has been copied elsewhere. Here's a link. ,gcc.upb.de/WWW/WI/WI2/wi2_lit.nsf/KPoolThemes , My sample app in the article actually lets you toggle between both secret key and public/private key encryption techniques."				
Thank you very much for these answers. I will try to implement these recommendations.				
"To RichardSchwartz: That seems like a life saver. Unfortunately, notes forum is offline, too. Waybackmachine holds at least the solution which will be:  PublicEncryptionKeys will not be recognized by NotesDocument.encrypt unless you first specify NotesDocument.encryptionKeys = <your secret encryption keys>"				
"Is the key to success here ""saved in the Notes Client""? So in other words, saved by a user in front of the screen or would this also work when the document is encrypted through an agent as your initial post was stating. Also, is Type ""Password"" really mandatory for this to work or is this just ""visual sugar"" to indicate a password style input field?"	Type			
"Sorry, but I have not done any further investigations on this topic. I am not even sure that saving the document with an agent would work. But I think that the Domino back-end simply takes the Names-field for a Directory lookup to get the public key and encrypts the field with it."

"Fair enough. Back to the public library extreme - what is the ""official"" reason you would document ""obvious"" for the html documentation? Is it because your audience may include very inexperienced programmers? Is it a user-experience enhancement to please the marketing department? Or that html documents are meant to be read as prose more than as code?"				
"It's for the sake of consistency, I guess. When you are reading a generated docs page, it'd look kind of unprofessional to have undocumented methods there, particularly because there can be some catch to them, like that they return null in some situations, can throw a runtime exception, or just some implementation details and usage tips. If you have only the name and parameters there, you might wonder if it really does what you think."

Please let me know how to best use OpenJDK"				
"Thanks for your reply. I will try to download the OpenJDK, and the subject you are talking is somehow needs my effort to understand completely. Anyhow, i will try to implement. Thanks."	OpenJDK			
"To sai_ana: You'll likely need to use a language that allows inline assembly like C or C++ if you want to learn to reimplement a system call like file API without any of the nice wrapper functions. I haven't checked OpenJDK source code, but it probably just uses the nice wrapper functions in C++ standard library or OS API rather than reimplementing it from scratch. But if that is what you want, it's worth it to check out the source code for glibc. A system call is an entirely different beast than a pure function like strlen()."

I am afraid this not the case here as I queried the database and found out that 221 edges are there in the database. I searched for the user's RID against the out property of edge 'Contributes' It showed me 221 edges then why only 40 is showing there?	user's			
"It's coming out 40 sir! but ,select * from contribute where out = 16:633, gives 221 rows"				
"Hi To Abhimanyu, have you done some delete operations ? If yes, what commands have you used ?"				
"Sir I haven't done any delete operations , but when I refresh I execute   ,try{ 			  graph.dropEdgeType(""Contribute""); 		  }catch(Exception e){ 			  e.printStackTrace(); 			  } 		  System.out.println(""=============Contribute deleted========="");,  This drops all the classes so deletes everything. That's all I use"				
I agree with To kichik but common practice is you have to maintain a document of what columnfamily/column data types you have and based on that you need to convert those to your known format	To			
Thank you very much for your commment. With the same user i can create the same attachments manually in the web interface. My are about 150 kb big.. so unfortunately i dont think that this is the problem. I also used another (3rd Party) application to generate same content so i dont think its a permission or attachment size problem.

"PUT/PATCH/POST , all go through the same assembler. The point is if somebody wants to disassociate the site from the cable, he can send a {""siteID"":null} . How do I now make out that the siteID was sent or not. For e.g. of the input json now is {""description"":""changed desc""}, then in both the cases I get siteID as null. In the latter case, the siteID should not be disassociated from the cable."	siteID			
"This is why PATCH method is preferred if you want to change only part of the entity. Your {""description"":""changed desc""} in PATCH will not overwrite siteId.

The major question with this: Is your singleton ""thread-safe""? And that's totally up to you. Store request-related state in your singleton, and you won't and you will get random errors as soon as you receive concurrent requests. Dont store request-related state and you are fine - your singleton would be ""thread-safe"" which means ""safe to use in multi-threaded environments""."

"Yes, it is, using Entities in your Controllers as response or request should be avoided at all costs. See your entities as the core of your business. These are the classes you use in your services and while doing some serious business logic. All the other classes (so-called DTOs) are used to get data and send data to the consumers of your API. This also means that you decouple your public model from your domain model, meaning that you can change any of those without having to modify the other (of course the mapping needs to be changed, but that is hidden from the consumers of your API)."

How could I find this problem in running code?"	error			
You cannot get there by putting breakpoints in your own code because that code is never even reached. You have some kind of security Funktionality i assume its Spring Security. If you only want to debug to where the error is thrown you will have to put breakpoints in the Spring Classes. This will not be that benefitial. If you want to change the Funktionality of you Security you will have to alter the SpringSecurity Configuration. Im not quiet sure what it is that you want to achive by debugging there when you know that the request itselve is the error.

To Stultuske I know it is not running because i have added logs and which not coming while running the API by command Gradle build where as same when I do with IntelliJ it does show me the logs.

"Why do you need multiple versions, typically you can do a lot of mutations to an API and maintain backwards compatibility. You often see the API version in the URL,  /v1/exampleapi/sayhello, you then use an adapter to upgrade older messages to the newest version, to avoid code douplication. Another possibility I have seen is to have one endpoint and include a version header."				
We have multiple clients to our api. Not all of them agree too move to new version. I want that at any point of time we can support any version without breaking or impacting existing functionality. Versioning through header or url is fine but i am looking for a solution that helps me maintain code behind the api's with minimum duplication.				
"Most of the time you try to upgrade the older messages to the newest version. I have done something similar with an internal setting protocol, which changed for every release, and sometimes even in hotfixes, so the server had to be able to talk to 5+ different client versions. The trick is to have simple converter which can upgrade only to the next version. When the client says he wants to talk version 3, you convert your version 5 message down to 4, then to 3 and upgrade from 3 to 5 when receiving. This way adding an extra version only requires converter from the previous to current version."

Furthermore we store snapshots (after commiting transactions). So you open a specific revision of the resource (the tree-structure) and you can manipulate and persist the changes.

"Assuming the floor is supposed to be transparent, you need to sort it into the middle of your cubes. Since it has different dimensions, it would probably be easiest to just make separate Models for the cubes above and below the floor. Then submit the three models in order from far to near. But if your floor is opaque, then you just need to draw it before you draw the transparent stuff. The trouble with transparent stuff is that you can never rely on depth testing...you have to draw all of it from far to near. Can't go back and insert something in the middle."				
"If the floor is intersecting multiple layers of cubes, you might need to break it up into six individual rectangles and break up the cube layers into more models so you can adequately draw them in order."				
Lets forget the transparency for a bit now. All the cubes in the video are fully opaque. They are sorted every frame just the way you said to. If I understand depth testing at least a little bit correctly I think that no depth testing is happening somehow. In the video some cubes should go half way through the big plane. And you can't see that happening they are either drawn fully in front of the big plane or aren't drawn at all.				
"This line I gave you: ,new DepthTestAttribute(false), turns off depth testing. You have to turn it off if drawing transparent cubes."				
Ahh totally missed that. Finally fixed things in my game to look the way they were before i tried to batch things up... yay!I turned the depth testing on. Without depth testing things looked good but when with shadows they messed up again a little bit. Depth testing plus sorting worked great for my games case. Thank you very much!

Accourding to your code you say you have a Vector of Vectors. According to the Exception it says you return a HashMap from the query. I can't help you don't know what data is return from the query. Your query is not part of the JDK so I can't help because I don't know what it does.	HashMap			
It would really help if you'd show a short but complete example of the code in each case. My guess is that you were using wildcard imports...	wildcard

At compile time, the compiler used the Rectangle class that was in the default package, not the one that I had imported from the java.awt package."",. I think Jon is right here, that OP uses wildcard imports. If not, then he would need the qualified class name (like in your example)."	Rectangle			
"Well in Java ,language, terms, imports only affect what names mean. It sounds like the Blackberry platform was doing some very odd things - if you're going to base any part of your answer on that, I would be very explicit about it. It's also unclear what you mean by "" java also always imports classes from System, String, Integer, Array, Float from the java.lang package"" - that makes it sound like System is a package too, etc. It's just that the compiler imports ,everything, from the java.lang package by default..."	everything

I doubt there is an universal answer to such a vague question. What kind of service are you offering? Does your API have an order in which actions should be processed?

Where is your json? and what you want to get? Pls provide enough information to help people understand your problem.	Where			
"FYI... We provide classes like ,JsonSlurper, which simplify parsing data from JSON without necessarily having to map to a custom type like the ,Car, class mentioned above.  There are times when object mapping is helpful of course but it is generally overkill if the goal is just to retrieve values from the JSON."	JsonSlurper			
To JeffScottBrown that is interesting (I always hate the boilerplate needed for just extraction purposes).  Is there a significant performance/memory gain?				
"The maps required to create the Cars have to be created regardless of whether or not Car objects are being created, so the Car creation is all unused overhead, unless there is some other reasons(s) to want the Car instances."	Cars			
"To JeffScottBrown What you said makes complete sense. But additionally I was curious to know how these 2 lines ""def json = slurper.parseText(jsonString); def envelope = json.envelope"" hold up in terms of performance against Jackson parsing."				
"Did you try FOLDOC first? ,foldoc.org/API, Their definition ,seemed, fairly ""layman"" to me."				
To pst I would have taken it for granted that the OP already looked at Wikipedia because who doesn't check Wikipedia?  Misplaced sarcasm on the possibility of using FOLDOC's 1995 definition before checking Wikipedia.  Should I delete the comment?

Are API's also used for the Internet of Things? Or how do IoT devices send and receieve data?	Things			
That last sentence is noteworthy and could be expanded upon...	upon			
Clearly explained with daily example Thanku so much will be helpfull to freshers like me

"May be because you aren't scanning ,kr.or.connect.finalproject.service.impl"	kr.or.connect.finalproject.service.impl

Maybe you have 2 classes that implement PromotionService?	PromotionService			
What you described is not possible. Perhaps some extra logging statements would help you find out what is really happening				
"Yes, I think we missed something really big, however we confirmed that after receiving the error page, the users are still added into our database. Will add more logging to verify tomorrow"				
"Thank you this works great on Eclipse. Do you mind if I also ask how to give several classifiers as input ? In this code I can only give 1 classifier although I can compare performance of this classifier on several datasets. So at the end, my aim is to have a matrix with the comparison of several classifiers and several datasets together."	classifier			
"If you look at the code again, where the classifier is being set, you can see that the classifier is added as an array (,exp.setPropertyArray(new Classifier[]{c}); ,). As the name of the class suggests, it shows you how to use the Experiment API (which is not trivial). Just pull out the relevant code bits and create your own experiment that way."				
"Your code looks like it's only calling the external API once, unless ,Employee::getId, is somehow making an external request. If you are very sure that nothing is calling ,your, API multiple times, it seems possible that it could be a bug in the external API. Have you attempted calling the external API via CURL, for example, and verifying that the API works at all?"				
"I haven't tried calling the api using CURL, but the other methods that work all use the same call to the api as the above, just with different processing. I'm not sure how/why but I think something must be calling my api multiple times for this method. I'll keep digging to see what I can come up with."	CURL			
Is it possible to capture NPE thrown by a webapp from the web browser?like will it show in the view page source from the web browser..	webapp			
"I understood everything you wrote there, but only because I've been coding for a while and know what a 'pointer' and a 'reference' are  (and what null is, for that matter).  When I try to dive right into explanations like that, my students look at me crosseyed, because there's not enough background."	'pointer'			
"A more common way to get a NullPointerException in practice would be forgetting to explicitly initialize a member variable to something other than ,null, before using it, ,like this,.  With local variables, the compiler would catch this error, but in this case it doesn't.  Maybe that would make a useful addition to your answer?"	it			
"To EJP I think your points are valid, so I've  updated the answer to be clearer and to avoid saying 'points to null' where it did."	'points			
To StevePowell I indicated a long time ago that I didn't want my answer to change. Please respect the intent of the original author.	change			
"Sorry, I was ""improving the answer"" as requested in the top of this stackoverflow item (,This question's answers are a collaborative effort: if you see something that can be improved, just edit the answer to improve it!,)  I disagree that your version is better, IMO To EJB has valid points; but you are quite welcome to keep your answer intact, confusing though it is."				
"To RuchirBaronia A debugger allows you to step through a program line by line to see which methods are called and how variables are changed. IDEs should have some tools to do this. See ,vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseDebugging/article.html, for example."	debugger			
"To RuchirBaronia You set breakpoints on the methods around any NullPointerExceptions as seen in the stacktrace, and check the values of variables against what you expect them to be. If you know a variable is null when it shouldn't be, then you can set breakpoints around any code that changes the value. There are also conditional breakpoints you can use which will tell you when a value changes."	stacktrace			
"i suggest also static analysis  tools, like FINDBUGS   ,en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FindBugs"	FINDBUGS			
"If we give System.out.println(a.length()); // NullPointerException will be thrown, to skip this we can handle with try catch block. thank you"	System.out.println(a.length())			
"Keep it simple, I like this answer, add this if you consider correct - Access to uninitialized attribute of an object"				
To Emiliano - simply accessing an initialized attribute does not cause an NPE.  It is what you >>do<< with the uninitialized attribute value that causes the NPE.	initialized			
"""A NULL pointer is one that points to nowhere"", I disagree. Null pointers don't point to nowhere, they point to null values."				
"In j2ee projects,Nullpointer exception is very common.Some cases reference variables got null values.So You should check the variable initialization properly.And during conditional statement you should always check that flag or reference contains null or not like:-  if(flag!=0) { ur code that uses flag }"				
"It is worth mentioning that some IDEs (e.g. Eclipse) offer automatic nullity analisys based on ,customizable, annotations (e.g. ,To Nullable, as listed above) and warn about potential errors. It is also possible to infer and generate such annotations (e.g. IntelliJ can do that) based on existing code structure."				
"First thing should do is before using a nullable object, you should check whether is it null, using ,if (obj==null),.If it is null then you should write code to handle that also."	nullable			
"IMO, it is preferable to avoid returning null objects in methods when possible and use annotation when null input parameters are not allowed in order to, by contract, reduce the amount of 麓if (obj==null)?in the code and improve the code readability."	annotation			
"Read this ... before you accept these ""best practices"" as truth: ,satisfice.com/blog/archives/27"	practices			
"While this is a nice example, may I ask what it adds to the question that isn't already covered by all the other answers?"				
"It is simply inappropriate to use the word ""uninitialized"" here.  The example you shown is in fact ""initialized"", and it is initialized with null.  For uninitialized variables, compiler will complain to you."				
"Or use exception capture: such as: try { 	yourRef.someMethod(); } catch (NullPointerException e) { 	// TODO }"				
To Shomu: At what point do I even suggest that it should be caught?

"Another approach is to have separate endpoints.  From the user perspective, they might be pressing a single button, but the back-end could make 2 calls (1 to create the new email and 1 to remove an old email).

"Another approach is to notify the other user the resource has been updated (callbacks, webhooks, topics, websockets, etc.), and update the other user's UI, along with their pending changes."	websockets			
"Another approach is to return a resource token when the resource is fetched.  When submitting an update, the token must be included in the request.  If the submitted token matches the actual resource token, then the update is allowed, and a new token is assigned as part of updating the resource.

To Andreas I tried this doing directly on the method itself and received nothing back then as well				
"You say you're trying to stream, but you're not ,streaming,. The code is building up the entire response in POJOs in ,recordsResult,, then mass-converting to JSON at the end.

Some form of caching might also help but it's hard to tell without having way more info - and that might be totally out of scope for SO."	bulkhead			
Thanks for the response. It is a 50k sequential request as per the client's requirement.  The time frame is 2.5 hours. The patterns you have mentioned will be helpful to me.				
How long does it take to fulfil a request like those? 50k in 2.5 hours (or 9000 seconds) is only about 5.5 to 6 requests per second on average - this is fairly low. You might need to also address the way requests are fulfilled.

As per the shared Java code , I am able to call the printer directly and print the barcode, the only issue is the size of the barcode printed is not in expected size.  pras.add(MediaSize.findMedia(40, 15, Size2DSyntax.MM));  I expected the label to print the barcode of 40mm x 15mm but actually it generates barcode of 20mm x 10mm size when printed. So I need to get the actual size there.   (PS: My current label size is 70mm x 28mm there, I had wrongly mentioned it as 700mm x 280mm in my initial post)"	Honeywell			
"If so, aren't you making a mistake in the value of the resolution and calculation that are the prerequisites for barcode creation? The resolution of the printer is 203dpi. Maybe you need to create a bit image for it and print it dot by dot?"

"To VinayakSatapute I inserted a ^LH command in my example program, this command sets the label home - maybe this helps. If not, try a few other values for the ^FO (field origin) command - sometimes a combination of other settings places the barcode completely outside of the label.

"After trying around few things , realized that this is half the story/question. I think I need to understand and may be ask here explicitly what I am trying to achieve as end goal. I am writing a service that will connect to collect say VM configuration data from various subscriptions in different azure tenants.  I have a Service principle created and got some test tenants invite me (user) as Guest User. Once I get the Subscriptions list as in original question I can collect data.  No login process involving browser though as the CLI forces."

Even using generics it doesnt mean it's type safe? The idea is to make sure all the key value pair are of one type

Please be more precise on what you want to make more type safe. Do you want to get rid of type Object for key and value?				
of the same type.	type			
but why is this type safe? How do we know we don't have instances of various objects being put in the cache? Where is that check being made?				
Because the type T is fixed when you implement this interface in a concrete class. For example when you do this: public class InternalCacheServiceImpl implements InternalCacheService<Integer>. In this case you fix the type T to be Integer for class InternalCacheServiceImpl. The compiler will then be able to check that the key and value are of type Integer.	InternalCacheServiceImpl			
Thank you! I appreciate it.				
I've extended the answer above with the example of type Integer. In this case the client who is using your cache via the interface is only able to put objects of type Integer into your cache although the data structure CacheElement theoretically could store any Object type.	Integer

"Well, in general when the api has methods like ,GET_DETAILS_BY_XXX, then I'd expect the response to be the same no matter what ,XXX, is. In that case you could also use a more complex object that describes properties of what you want to get and use the information in that request object to determine the actual call (e.g. one could pass a range of ids as well as a pattern for the name and get all students whose id is in that range and whose name matches the pattern - or you just pass a range like [x,x] to get one specific id only)."

Hello To M.Deinum I'm reading some articles about Apache Shiro. What do you recomend to me?	Apache			
"I'm biased towards Spring Security as it integrates reallly nice, but Apache Shiro also has Spring integration."	Shiro			
"To M.Deinum is basically right, but expressed technical detail in a way easy to misunderstand about AspectJ: ,Spring AOP, is based on dynamic proxies. ,AspectJ, however, about which the OP was talking (hint: modified class files) is not, no matter if used via compile-time weaving, as M. Deinum said, nor via load-time weaving, which is the usual way Spring users apply AspectJ and is described well in the Spring manual. So with LTW you can keep your original class files (even though I would argue that the AspectJ compiler does not ""obfuscate"" them) and have the full power of AspectJ."	files)			
AspectJ when used with Spring still uses the same Spring AOP infrastructure. AspectJ is applied the same as regular aopalliance interceptors. It will only change if you yourself configure compile-timeweaving OR loadtimeweaving. The latter isn't enabled by default and all AOP is thus by default (regardless of the way of expression the AOP) by proxies.	Spring

What is the value returning from insertTimeSheet() method ? is it saved timesheet id?				
To Vimukthi_R The insert method will return INT if the data is saved successfully i.e 1.				
Is it a random integer value? what will return if not saved successfully?				
assertEquals will check if two values are equal. If yes test passes else test fails. You need to compare the value returned with the success case value from your method.				
To Vimukthi_R it will return 0 if it is not saved successfully.				
add TimeSheet constructor method. issue is in your insertTimesheet() method. You are trying to get null value from passed timeSheet object				
I have  already created constructor method in timesheet.Can you please give me example.	constructor			
"new Timesheet( 1001 ,""2019-01-10"", ""2019-01-05"", ""comment section is this "", ""saved"", null, null), In here what are these null values ?"				
"whenever a new timesheet is added the status will be ""SAVED"" and approve date & approve by value will be null. That's the approve date & by value."	SAVED

To JonathanJohx That won't help. Spring will commit the transaction after each REST call - resulting in three separate transactions.				
So you want to commit one only on several requests? Because from controller enters to services ypu can manage the curremt transaction in order to do create/update/delete on the same transaction by using several commits.	curremt			
"interesting situation. Correct me if I am wrong but you probably need to actually perform each request/operation in order to track somehow user's actions (case in which you can just create a separate api for this).

"You are right. It works, since I added the values to the url directly. Thank you very much! :-) I would mark your answer as solution, if You want."				
That's going to completely depend on the author of the actual API.  There's not a standard way of specifying filters across all URLs.

Can you please share you code so we can see what is going on? Are you querying a web service or did you create the web service? If it is your web service have you considered returning a JSON string instead of passing the ArrayList to whatever it is that is generating the JSON?	JSON			
"Hey, thanks for the answer. I will check this and see if it helps"				
Do you know what is the error that is happening?				
Well the error that will eventually happen is a null pointer exception. This is but I have since discovered that the reason the later method is returning null is because these methods return a 500 - internal server error.

You can always have your REST interface to accept and return String type and you have to do parsing on your side to deal with different content."

The JSON has a toptracks property. So you need that in your top-level class. Its value is an object in the JSON. So you create another class to model this object.

"If the ,onFailure(), is called the problem is probably not that the server doesn't accept your request. It's usually a fundamental problem.

"DO NOT INCLUDE CREDENTIALS IN THE URL PARAMS OF A GET REQUEST,."				
"There are two kinds of tokens - access tokens and session tokens. Access tokens should not expire - the user should authenticate and request a token; that token should then be included ,as a header at least, with every request.

A REST application should be stateless, so session tokens should not be used."	tokens			
"Further ,?action=XXX, Is not REST - It鈥檚 鈥淛. Doe鈥檚 magic API? REST would require a URL mapped to a resource and a HTTP verb to carry out an action, for example ,GET /token, would create a token and ,DELETE /token, would invalidate a token."	/token

"I'm not sure if i understand all the context of the problem. You have a legacy application which run on it's own authentication service, and you need to build a different service as a RESTful API and you need to authenticate both, right?  If that's the problem you could find a way to authenticate the RESTful web service, via your existing web application service. If you need to authenticate both, you could write an API who does the authentication and implement it in the web api and on the RESTful service."				
"I wouldn't call it a legacy application, as it will still need to function/run while/after the api is being built. I need to create a Secure REST API (thinking of using api keys or something along those lines; still researching that aspect). The application currently does use REST (mostly, but not completely) for handling data requests, but it's not completely locked down. Most of the authentication that occurs for the application is via a user login. I suspect that it will be difficult to maintain and secure the existing REST services within the web app, hence the question."

If you're new to programming maybe don't start with a stack that requires years of training and learning.

You spring boot api is just endpoints that you could call. for example if you have and endpoint like this  /searchdata/{id}  you have to connect to your sping api from your java program and then call the endpoint by passing parameters (here it's a path parameter 'id).

If you just want to sync your app with latest data then you can send triggers from your back-end server and in app when you get that trigger update the data via api call.
