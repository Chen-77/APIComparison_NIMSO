"While mapping HTTP operations to simple CRUD operations might sound like a good idea, HTTP operations in genearal are to general to support such a mapping blindly. I.e. ,DELETE, only gurantees that the connection between the URL and the resource is removed but leaves the client clueless whether the server also removes the data belonging to the resource as well. A client in general is usually not interested in such internal decisions anyway as long as the resource state isn't retrievable any longer."	HTTP	0	1	0	0	o
"Further, the spec leaves room for interpretation. DELETE i.e. only states that certain response codes should be returned if the operation actually removed something but not what should happen if i.e. the resource was not available at all.

Java is a very old language that has gone through many iterations and they try like hell to be backward compatible. This is akin to Python < 3.0. Java unfortunately does not have a benevolent dictator like Ruby and Python so changes that break stuff are very hard to get placed in the language (we have an evil fat/lazy dictator named oracle). If it really bothers you I recommend you look at Scala (which has the opposite problem of changing everything every release).	Java	0	1	0	0	o

I think you got confused with SpringDataRest. It's automatically exposing rest controllers for all your entities (including CRUD operations). as you requested the service with /person you actually called the automatically generated controller and not your method.

If you're new to programming maybe don't start with a stack that requires years of training and learning.

You spring boot api is just endpoints that you could call. for example if you have and endpoint like this  /searchdata/{id}  you have to connect to your sping api from your java program and then call the endpoint by passing parameters (here it's a path parameter 'id).
