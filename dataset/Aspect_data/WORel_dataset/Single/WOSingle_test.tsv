If you look at the LinkedList implementation it contains an optimization for the index based lockup: If the index is after the half size of the list then then the traversal starts at the end and goes backwards.

"To Adamski -  I like this. But if the caller is already throwing the Exception, this exception would be muted right?

One of the problems i don't like using Aether it's that i have to create a temporary repository just for fetching an artifact into it. I don't want Aether to download the file. I just want to know which is latest version of the artifact and where is it on the network. Imagine that i have an application distribution zip which doesn't have any dependant artifacts so it's just standing alone. I can fetch that easily by myself or even better unpack it on the fly while downloading.	Aether	0	1	0	0	n
