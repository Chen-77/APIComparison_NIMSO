o	"By the way, you'll see in this comment (,vimeo.com/forums/topic:49393#comment_6729467,) on the Vimeo API forum (which for some reason I can't post to) that there's something weird about the last bit. I'm guessing this means that on my last iteration, I need to set the content range to be ,14680064-15125119/15125120, instead of ,14680064-15125120/15125120, for example. Right?"",""If you look at the documentation (,vimeo.com/api/docs/upload,) toward the bottom under """"Verify the Upload"""" you'll see in their example they have: ,Content-Range: bytes 1001-339108/339108, and the length of their whole file is 339108. But I'll give it a shot. Because of that forum thread I showed you I'm a little less than trusting of their documentation...  ... tested. No change."	Vimeo API	0	1	0	0
