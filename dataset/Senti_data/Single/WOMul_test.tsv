On the mobile browser, it worked but not on the Andriod app.  Then  I used volley and the problem was solved."	192.168.0.100	0	1	0	0	p

"Yes, that's true. I guess that depending on what is the ratio of methods to be kept / methods to be rejected, one of the solutions might look ""cleaner"" than the other one. e.g. if you only want to forbid 2-3 methods out of 20, then A probably looks cleaner. If you only want to keep 2-3 methods out of 20, then B looks cleaner. But everything else being equal I also tend to prefer B over A."	A	0	1	0	0	o

"To Andrew. Not coupling to the host but to the properties keys them selves. Think about this, java.lang.System was among the first classes in Java. Back then they didn't quite knew what was going to be the platform like. It was aimed for TV sets, Futurist devices ( such as *7 ) among other things. My guess ( because as S.Lott correctly points out only James Gosling and the original team will know now ) is they thought different platforms may return different system properties."	java.lang.System	0	0	0	1	o
