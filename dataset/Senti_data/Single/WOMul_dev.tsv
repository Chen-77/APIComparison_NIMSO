Based on the feedback here I have decided to use constructor injection and to remove the default constructor as the parent of a component can never change by design (immutable heritage).  There is a single interface type that is permitted to have an empty parent and all methods that call getParent() are aware that the top node will return null.  If any other type of class provides null in the constructor then I throw an IllegalArgumentException so that it will fail fast. I also documented in the code that parent should always be non-null (along with the exceptional case).	getParent()	0	0	0	1	o
