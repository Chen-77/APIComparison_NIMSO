stackoverflow.com/questions/3612567NULL	If only you alone ever need to change the checking function but your users are never supposed to change them, then I would definitely use public static methods for these functions. But if somehow possible, I'd consider adding a single default checking method instead of multiple ones. E.g. just ,public static check(People),. This default method could then call the more specific functions like ,checkName,, ,checkAddress, etc. as appropriate. This way your users would perhaps not need to change their code each time you add a new checking function to your code.  	checkName	0	1	0	0	o

What kind of filtering, validation, rejection do you want? For example, you can create your own MessageBodyWriter/Reader to handle validation. Or you can set the To Context in the constructor for custom HTTP header parsing or URI parsing.   	Most applications of this feature would be related to security.  For example, my (non-Jersey) web application will generate one-time-use nonces for certain AJAX calls (all under the same path) to Jersey.  The interceptor would be responsible for checking the validity of this nonce.  	MessageBodyWriter/Reader	0	0	0	0	o

Not an expert on Spring REST but I assume that the controller is mapping to some URI (like /fault) and you are telling it to handle POST /fault for FaultDTO and List<FaultDTO>).

Your assumption is wrong.   	I think there is no way because it's limited by the hardware. Your device has 512mb physically, but the hardware splits it up between gpu and memory available to the system. You could perhaps find out about the memory available to the gpu and add that to the value the system reports. But I don't know if there's a way to find out if the gpu memory is on the same physical chip. Of course if both add up to a power of 2 when either of them is no power of 2, that would be a strong hint because AFAIK, all RAM modules ship with a memory amount that is a power of 2.

I know this is an old thread, but I'm here because I'm trying to figure out how to deal with supporting side-by-side versions of an API.

My app needs to support integration to whichever version a client has in their environment, so I think I need to treat the version as a configuration option and provide some kind of switch to varying underlying logic.

If I understand correctly, you need to send an API key in a header while accessing this URL. This is not something that is easily done using the standard library (not sure if it can be done at all).

Read this blog post, on the NetworkOnMainThreadException for more information. It explains why this occurs on Android 3.0 and above.   	To Gavriel it creates duplicates of everything you annotate, whether it's a method, activity, fragment, singleton etc, so there is twice as much code and it takes longer to compile it. It may also have some issues due to bugs in the library. Debugging and finding errors would become more difficult.  	above	0	0	0	1	o

It's not a problem on your side. You are connecting to a server, and both you and the server have a certificate. This is mutual SSL authentication. The server must follow some rules and one of them is that the domain name must be specified a the subject or SAN. If you check the stackoverflow certificate in your browser (the green lock) you will see that it was issued to *.stackexchange.com (not the domain you are connecting to), but one of the SANS is *.stackoverflow.com (which is the right domain). This allows us to use the same certificate in more than one endpoint.   	I see what you are saying. I will request from them that they fix the cert that they provided us and include the SAN.

Why did you decide to use ,StreamingResponseBody, when you're not actually ,streaming, the response as you're building it? The point of ,StreamingResponseBody, is that it provides a callback method for you to implement, passing the ,OutputStream, to that method, so the method can write directly to the output stream as the response is generated. Your lambda expression ,outputStream -> streamService.getLocationData(), is not using the ,outputStream, parameter, so yu get no response data. What were you trying to accomplish by using ,StreamingResponseBody,?   	I understand that some projects already use V1. I will look into Spring and V1.

Thanks for the answer Enmanuel. This looks more of a workaround. Do you also know how it can be handelled via ResponseEntity, as I was having touble to find an adequate source from the same. Also ResponseEntity has much more information, that I was hoping to further use.   	The thing is that the class RestTemplate throws those 3 exceptions when you use the method getForObject, getForEntity, exchange, etc. RestTemplate has something called ResponseErrorHandler, which as the name suggests, handles the errors. By default, RestTemplate uses the implementation DefaultResponseErrorHandler which throws the exception when there's an HTTP response 4XX or 5XX. So, if you want to work the way you are trying, you need to implement your own ResponseErrorHandler.

If you subclass e.g. ,ArrayList, and override the ,get(int index), method to do something different, then all other methods that you haven't overridden are handled by the ,ArrayList, class code. --- You should however be aware that the result can be weird, because if you make ,get(int index), return something that isn't in the list, then someone who iterates the list will be baffled by the discrepancy. So ,beware, what you're doing.  	ArrayList	0	1	0	0	o
Is it better to create and print a barcode with the printer's own function than to print a barcode image created with other software? ,PC42t Desktop Printer User Guide - Honeywell Scanning and,, ,How to create a Printer Command Code generator in Windows   	To VinayakSatapute I inserted a ^LH command in my example program, this command sets the label home - maybe this helps.

Seconding the suggestions from To Matthew Flaschen and To denisk - either store the db on a server you control and access it via a network connection, or encrypt the database and access an auth server to get access.   	Thanks for the info.I envision multiple programs using the API concurrently which mean concurrent access to the DB as well.

How well this plays with maven dependencies, I also have other requirements where I need to make some database operations and doing that on JDBC would probably outweight the convenience of having the OSGI framework for supporting the runtime plugin architecture. Also, how well this standard compares to Apache Karaf?  Since In my understanding I could potentially use Karaf + JAX-RS for the REST endpoints.   	1) OSGi enRoute allows the addition of all maven dependencies through JPM. 2) Notice that OSGi is not an app server. You bring your own dependencies you do not have to depend on a limited set of standard services available. The enRoute REST is actually a POJO mapping to REST with JSON. This is a lot more OSGi and therefore easier to use than JAX-RS.  (And easy to port to JAX-RS if the need should arise one day.) 3) there is an OSGi spec for a REST API on an OSGi framework.

Thanks for this. I would agree, it's important to maintain the consistency/integrity of data across endpoints. But (a) is more convenient imo, (e.g. when client is iterating through a list). What about going with (a) and including the quantityAvailable and priceForDates in all endpoints. quantityAvailable and priceForDates could be set to null when they aren't used or relevant. Or is this bad practice?   	I wouldn't do that. Not only I don't think it is easier for any client (iterating a list of (a) or (b) is equally simple, and (b) is better organized) but you must not add attributes to other endpoints that are not relevant in those cases just because you need them elsewhere. Option (b) is by far the best option.  	quantityAvailable	0	1	0	1	o

I tried this solution, but it seems not to work. The exception is actually thrown but the response stream contains no data. If I try the same request with POSTMAN the response body contains the body, so it seems again a RestTemplate problem.   	To Marios, thank you for your efforts.

Some IDEs have a warning for this situation.   	While this may be correct in theory, it would be an extremely ugly hack to create multiple classes with equals() and hashcode() implementations that work this way.

Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class. I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.   	"In your 'getFizzByBuzz' example you say in the comments that ""We asked API to send back a Fizz as JSON, so responseBody is a JSON String"". So why do you need to check the type of the response?

Sending the ,accept, header from client just tells the server that your client is able to understand ,application/json,. ,Content-Type, tells the server what kind of data you are sending, ,Accept, server-side means that the server can understand that language. So, if ,Accept, from server and ,Content-Type, from client don't match, you'll get a 415.

Making the code in a Java SE application from the beginning, since it is connected to the database, is a problem, since any decompiler will expose the credentials of your database.

The best would be to not reinvent your security framework. Which to use depends on what you want to secure, if you want to secure services there is no ,HandlerInterceptor, that will help you. AspectJ is also applied using proxies when using Spring unless you configure compile timeweaving. However as mentioned don't try to reinvent a security framework there are plenty out there use those instead. Generally they do more then just role/group based access.   	"To M.Deinum is basically right, but expressed technical detail in a way easy to misunderstand about AspectJ: ,Spring AOP, is based on dynamic proxies. ,AspectJ, however, about which the OP was talking (hint: modified class files) is not, no matter if used via compile-time weaving, as M. Deinum said, nor via load-time weaving, which is the usual way Spring users apply AspectJ and is described well in the Spring manual. So with LTW you can keep your original class files (even though I would argue that the AspectJ compiler does not ""obfuscate"" them) and have the full power of AspectJ.  "	Spring	0	1	1	0	p

DO NOT INCLUDE CREDENTIALS IN THE URL PARAMS OF A GET REQUEST,.   	There are two kinds of tokens - access tokens and session tokens.

Assuming the floor is supposed to be transparent, you need to sort it into the middle of your cubes. Since it has different dimensions, it would probably be easiest to just make separate Models for the cubes above and below the floor. Then submit the three models in order from far to near. But if your floor is opaque, then you just need to draw it before you draw the transparent stuff. The trouble with transparent stuff is that you can never rely on depth testing...you have to draw all of it from far to near. Can't go back and insert something in the middle.   	Ahh totally missed that. Finally fixed things in my game to look the way they were before i tried to batch things up... yay!I turned the depth testing on. Without depth testing things looked good but when with shadows they messed up again a little bit. Depth testing plus sorting worked great for my games case. Thank you very much!

what is orderStatus() overriding?  It's supposed to be the method in the EWrapper interface.  Note that some of the status changes are your responsibility to program - the 'pending' ones.   	OrderStatus is overriding the IOrderHandler interface definition in ApiController.java (lines 669 through 671), roughly in the same manner that a methedo with the same name is overriden in ILiveOrderHandler (lines 711 through 716).  I can get the ILiveOrderHandler overrides to work and provide me with the order data with no problems; I encounter issues receiving data with IOrderHandler - my workaround has consisted in filtering the results of orderStatus from ILiveOrderHandler by order id in order to get a smiliar result.  	methedo	0	1	0	0	o

No you will not repeat pieces of code.  Your will write the code once, package it, and reuse it.  But hopefully you will not have to do that because your security framework will have code that you can easily integrate into your web service container.   	Just remember, microservices is not a protocol.  It is more of a design philosophy to not make big applications with a lot of services.  Instead you are able to leverage the various pieces of code that are easy to integrate and use for creating smaller applications.

My rule of thumb is never to return a null from my methods, but an empty object.   	I was not talking about in the case of not knowing what an API method could return, but rather, in the case of having possible values passed to a method that will return null. Consider having a List<X> containing 'null' at index 4, and you call list.get(4), returning a null value for data you might've expected to be non-null. In this case, you would require a null-check because you're not sure if the method will return null. It doesn't imply a broken method; it implies an unexpected error that should be accounted for. Using an Optional, or anything similar, would be effectively the same.  	list.get(4)	0	1	0	1	o

You can publish the API in an interface and make all implementations package local, for instance. Also, this is not true that a Java source file requires a public class: your class can be package local. You can declare ,class XX {}, in XX.java. This means XX will only be accessible from the same pacakge.   	I second that; especially the 'extensibility' part, of course :) - However, it seems to me that many programmers fail to (fore-)see why and how users will want to extend their code - and a single method or field carelessly declared ,private, (or even lazily 'declared' package-private) can exclude a whole lot of useful extensibility. Thus, I endorse ,careful, and reflected use of visibilites; and in that, I think, we agree after all.  	Java	0	0	0	0	o

I am not familiar with that API but what is the issue if two different exceptions share same error codes?  isn't ,EDAMSystemException, and ,EDAMUserException , be thrown in distinct situations / events( that seems obvious from exception names ) ? Why are you using single catch for both exceptions? I guess its your coding issue to be concerned only about error codes without being bothered about actual cause of issue. I think, same kind of error can be thrown on two different and distinct events - some activity by user and some system action.   	Yes, but the issue is both of those Exceptions share the same enum for errors and it does not clearly say anywhere which errorcode is for what exception. If I was to design that I would make 2 enums and Exception A would only throw errors with enum A and Ex B would throw stuff with exception B. As it stands it kinda indicates that those errors could share some codes, but its not defined clearly which ones. Thats why I wanted to handle them in the same clause (Cant figure out which exception is thrown with which errorCode - not well documented)  	EDAMSystemException	0	0	0	1	o

To Matthew Flaschen: Some classes in the IO package are handled rather poorly as far as charsets. ,PrintWriter, and ,FileReader, are examples. I think ,PrintWriter, should probably only be allowed to wrap another ,Writer, (rather than having all the other overloads) and ,FileReader, just shouldn't be used... ,FileInputStream, + ,InputStreamReader, instead.   	I believe the InputStreamReader is a 'bridge' between a Reader and an InputStream.  Read Fazal's answer below.	PrintWriter	0	0	0	0	o

I'm surprised you get a CORS error when you request JSONP - that makes no sense, because JSONP can never result in a CORS error.   	your opening statement ,I want to use jsonp, suggests you didn't understand the comments in your previous questions. JSONP is something that the server has to support. JSONP is not how you get around CORS because you want to, JSONP is how an API offers to help you get around CORS because they don't know how or don't want to enable CORS but still want to allow connections from a client. The simplest solution is to ,proxy, the request via ,your, server, thus avoiding CORS, and using the API as it was meant to be used  	jsonp	0	0	0	1	o

Hi To devconsole. I took a look to the ContextThemeWrapper.java source and I didn't find the implementation of the method ,getResources(),.

To janzoner And yes, it calls ,super.getResources(), which calls ContextWrapper's implementation which in turn calls ,mBase.getResources(),.

You should be using Spring Security OAuth2. It is very bad practice to send credentials in a GET request like this; they should be in the ,Authorization, header so they aren't logged or cached. Spring Security will take care of decoding the token for you (once you provide the key), and then you can use the regular ,To PreAuthorize, and similar to add access rules.   	Ok , I do get that above To GetMapping part but the given example is actually generating the jwt Token , if I not wrong. But in my case , I should not be concerned about that generating part as I would be given the token. So, only the GetMapping part will be all that I should worry about. Right?

I'm accepting this answer because I mentioned I want it published as an enum and there is no other way of doing it. Although I went on a different path because I wanted to expose some of the additional functionality (but not all), and obviously it is undesirable to duplicate the additional functionality. Instead I exposed the enums as interfaces where the additional functionality that I want to publish are part of the interface, and enum constants are also listed as interface constants. This solution also avoids having to make conversions and implementation changes.   	Maybe instead of this you can try to expose attributes with getter methods and even returning defensive copies to defend yourself from misuse?  If this is not possible, then I am afraid that you will need to redesign your library with a strict division between private logic and public DTOs visible to the API user.  	enum	0	1	0	0	o

I'm surprised you get a CORS error when you request JSONP - that makes no sense, because JSONP can never result in a CORS error.   	your opening statement ,I want to use jsonp, suggests you didn't understand the comments in your previous questions. JSONP is something that the server has to support. JSONP is not how you get around CORS because you want to, JSONP is how an API offers to help you get around CORS because they don't know how or don't want to enable CORS but still want to allow connections from a client. The simplest solution is to ,proxy, the request via ,your, server, thus avoiding CORS, and using the API as it was meant to be used  	API	0	1	0	1	o

Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class.

The only reason I can see for preventing the go() method in class A, B, and C from running concurrently is that they're sharing something.  If that's class data or database data, you should try to redesign so they share nothing.  That would allow them to run concurrently and not worry about interfering.  If that's not possible, then you should have one service that calls them in proper sequence to ensure that they can't be called out of order.

I think the problem is the use of GetKeyboardState: from MSDN, sounds like it's essentially equivalent to calling GetKeyState, whereas you want the equivalent for GetAsyncKeyState, since another thread has current input focus. Perhaps try populating keystate manually with GetAsyncKeyState, or using AttachInput?   	My point is that ToUnicode should work out this shift information for you: but it needs accurate keyboard state information to work - it likely pulls the modifier information from that keyboard table, but since it's being fetched with GetKeyboardState, it does not necessarily reflect actual modifier state, which may be why it's returning unshifted characters. You might want to check if any of the keys corresponding to modifiers are pressed in the keystate array when you expect them to be.  	GetKeyboardState	0	1	0	0	o

I did contemplate using IllegalFormatException directly, but it only exists in Java 1.5+, and this library I'm writing is 1.4 compatible.  Starting out with IllegalArgumentException could work well.

There are many ways to consume RESTful APIs - typically, you need to know what version of the API you are going to use.

Thanks man. It worked. Now I just need to parson this Jason to get confidence value. Can you also help me in that as I am a beginner?   	I'm still learning as well. I do remember using org.json while playing around with Android in the past to parse JSON. You can use that as well here. I've edited my answer to add code responsible for parsing the JSON and getting the confidence value.  First, you need to download the *.jar file and add it to your project's external libraries so that it can be added to the classpath during compilation.

	Your API should be hosted on a server that is always running you cannot host it on Github (Github just hosts the code). From there, you will be able to make calls to the API from any other machine, including the same one. The node.js app is the server in this case.  Next you can create a client app/script to interact with the server. First you need to create an express route that allows your API to send the data you would like to send to the client.

In this case, I would say all exceptions caught are unlikely to happen. Therefore I would go for wrapping them in a more general exception - a custom exception.  I won't allow them to catch different level of exception since API users won't have access to the implementation details and won't be able to fix the problem. Hence, one exception to catch them all.   	The API must not bleed implementation details. Therefore I agree with you regarding waraping all exceptions in one main exception.  Also, I think IllegalStateException is not an appropriate exception and I should go for something like OperationNotPerformedException which would indicate that the function cannot do its job properly due to some exceptional circumstances (detailed in the exception message).

This provides some information and examples but I don't see how it relates back to the original question.  The API doesnt look inside files when you run ,isRegularFile(),? or ever?  A file might be many things, but it's not stated which of those examples count as 'opaque'.   	"To user1445967 - I'm not sure I understand the comment. Of course one can (usually) look inside a file with Java (by opening and reading it). The point of the answer is that this particular method will decide whether a file is a ""regular file"" (as opposed to a directory, symbolic link, or other [e.g., ,/dev/tt0, on Unix]) based only on information from outside the file itself. It's not that there is such a thing as a ""file with opaque content"", it's simply that this method doesn't use the file contents when deciding whether or not it is a regular file.  "	link	0	0	0	0	o

Linking the two classes would probably result in bad design. When a new invoice is being created, why don't you query the ,clientService, to check if the client exists?

Use Java generics to solve this   	Just be careful about over-engineering this.  Clients use your library; events happen; there are data associated with those events.  All you need to do is define an interface that passes the client that event data and let them define the implementation they need.  Then allow the client to register for the event.  In that sense, To CodeLionX 's answer is a little more accurate for your situation.

Why not define the payload as just array of resources (objects)? And in case of single object just pass array of single resource.   	Actually, the discussion over the noun used on the path is not relevant due to the assumption that is more reliable to use plurals over singulars. Also, you are giving to the noun the responsibility to inform if it accepts something and how it does it (and thats is another assumption, but is wrong in this case).

"Have you read about TargetDataLine.read(byte[] b, int off, int len) method? Documentation says you can read any portion of internal buffer.

Since you cannot control reading position, it is controlled internally. Also the ""tail"" should be known internally. Hence TargetDataLine is FIFO for bytes.

However, that shouldn't be anything to keep you from it: You can implement a redirect/url-rewrite in Apache, offering a pretty URL on Apache that is forwarded to an ugly portal URL. Or you can implement FriendlyURLs if you want to stay in the portal world. There are Liferay APIs for this.

Your API should be hosted on a server that is always running you cannot host it on Github (Github just hosts the code). From there, you will be able to make calls to the API from any other machine, including the same one. The node.js app is the server in this case.

Note that this method just flags the document for encryption. Once it is flagged, encryption is automatic when you save with the current id file, and decryption is automatic when you open with it.  Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption. (The reason being that a signature does not give the agent access to fhe id file conttainging the key pair.)   	Ah, it's starting to come back to me... The documentation for this method is talking about using secret encryption keys, not public/private key pairs - but you can do it. I wrote an article about this many years ago.

To Ross: Open Sound Control looks very interesting. It will get a good chunk of my time today.

A lot of the timeout settings can be controlled at the JVM level (see Snicolas' response).

No, for instance in a tree-structure, nodes should only be created from within a transaction.

From a pure design point of view, they are two different models from two separate services and your service make a bridge between the two.

Your method accepts ,application/json, but you are sending ,application/x-www-form-urlencoded,.

Never underestimate the powers of idiocy...   	It's a nice pattern, but the downside is that I think it would confuse some people.  I updated my post to show results of a few tests that show that cloning and then iterating is OK performance wise.

You can publish the API in an interface and make all implementations package local, for instance. Also, this is not true that a Java source file requires a public class: your class can be package local. You can declare ,class XX {}, in XX.java. This means XX will only be accessible from the same pacakge.   	If a class is not carefully designed to be extendable, and is not intended to be extended, it should be final. That's another recommendation of Josh Bloch, IIRC. But extending a framework or API can be done (and, most of the time, should be done) without extending any class, but by wrapping them and using delegation instead of inheritance.  	Java	0	1	0	0	o

I suspect I was wondering if when the running thread updated the condition and called ,unpark,, if that would by itself guarantee the unparked thread would see the updated condition in a consistent state.

There's no easy solution for this in Java: either you duplicate or  use code generators (that's how, say, Trove has fast TIntLongHashMap, which are only using primitives [and hence much faster than the default Java HashMap]) or you use objects, and live with the huge performance penalty. Auto-(un)boxing millions of primitives and generating millions of needless objects is a sure way to kill the perfs. Which is why for big collections of primitives the default Java API and stuff based on clean OO simply doesn't cut it. That's when you use things like Trove. It comes down to your requirements.

I had no idea these functions existed in ByteBuffer. I am going to have to play with them before being able to answer definitively. I always do the assembly manually (take the high byte and shift and add to the low byte). As a guess, make sure BIG_ENDIAN is correct for both input and output & that you are actually doing this correctly on the output end. That could account for what you are hearing, if LITTLE_ENDIAN is required for playback, or if the ByteBuf is defaulting LITTLE_ENDIAN on your putShort but needs to be BIG_ENDIAN.   	Thanks for the answer. I've tried with both LITTLE and BIG, if I put LITTLE I hear only noise, if I use the code as above (by default is BIG) I can perceive the sound, but with a lot of white noise above. So I think the endian is ok. Sorry I am very new with Java, I converted bytes to short for handle values in a easier way, but how would it be working with bytes directly?  	LITTLE	0	0	0	0	o

To Ross: Open Sound Control looks very interesting. It will get a good chunk of my time today. But it doesn't necessarily replace MIDI as much as stand in for it, at least the way I read the home page. There must be a technological leap away from MIDI, doesn't there? If we can't access synthesizers through MIDI or OSC, what do we do? That is the question I'm trying to ask. What if we have to do real interactivity with DSP? Or some other hardware? I don't know hardware... I only know a bit of MIDI and c++.   	I don't see a trend towards supporting it in software so I wonder if there is going to be a lack of support in hardware. That's my concern. And if there is we need to find some other way to create musical applications. So I'm trying to figure out if there is already an alternative that I don't know about and that I should be considering.	Control	0	1	0	0	p
You should probably think about this again - ,new WeakReference<>(new Whatever()), could result in the weak reference referencing nothing since the newly created object is not strongly referenced anywhere (unless it creates a reference to itself somewhere in its constructor).   	Yes. That's why I removed the weak references. However there are cases where it might be useful. If you have business objects that are being used elsewhere and are also listeners then you might want to add them to listen to things but still have them GCd. Even that isn't ideal though as you could drop all references to something but it would still be receiving events for an unknown time afterwards and wasting resources. Basically in the end I decided that weak references just aren't useful for listeners.	Whatever())	0	1	0	0	o

How could it be more secure to distribute all the data to every client?  A secure API that provides only the required data on demand seems much better.

Note that this method just flags the document for encryption. Once it is flagged, encryption is automatic when you save with the current id file, and decryption is automatic when you open with it.  Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption.

You sound a little confused; ROC curves, by default, are calculated across all possible threshold values, and not for specific ones - see ,stackoverflow.com/questions/47104129 , for some explanation   	ROC is pointless with classification methods, as the decision has already been made by the algorithm and there is no threshold to vary any longer.

Thanks for this. I would agree, it's important to maintain the consistency/integrity of data across endpoints. But (a) is more convenient imo, (e.g. when client is iterating through a list). What about going with (a) and including the quantityAvailable and priceForDates in all endpoints. quantityAvailable and priceForDates could be set to null when they aren't used or relevant. Or is this bad practice?   	I wouldn't do that. Not only I don't think it is easier for any client (iterating a list of (a) or (b) is equally simple, and (b) is better organized) but you must not add attributes to other endpoints that are not relevant in those cases just because you need them elsewhere. Option (b) is by far the best option.  	(b)	0	1	0	0	n

If these places try adding null, I want to ignore that addition. But I do not want to force everywhere to catch the IllegalArgumentException I would get if I used a PredicatedList.

It sounds like you try to reinvent the wheel with the Aether library. so i would take a deep look into the Aether lib and may be ask on their mailing list to see if a possibility exist to use a different artifact resolver (downloading later etc.).

PUT and POST are meant for different things. Generally speaking if you want to create a NEW record in your service, then you use a POST.  However, if you have an existing record and you want to (UPDATE IT), meaning you need to retrieve it from the DB, Update, Save, then that is a PUT.   You can still use POST but the affect on the RAM/CPU is the same(if you use PUT/POST on this action)  I suggest you read ,rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-9.5, to get general information   	As others have already explained, the meaning of PUT and POST is different.

I am not familiar with that API but what is the issue if two different exceptions share same error codes?  isn't ,EDAMSystemException, and ,EDAMUserException , be thrown in distinct situations / events( that seems obvious from exception names ) ? Why are you using single catch for both exceptions? I guess its your coding issue to be concerned only about error codes without being bothered about actual cause of issue. I think, same kind of error can be thrown on two different and distinct events - some activity by user and some system action.   	Yes, but the issue is both of those Exceptions share the same enum for errors and it does not clearly say anywhere which errorcode is for what exception. If I was to design that I would make 2 enums and Exception A would only throw errors with enum A and Ex B would throw stuff with exception B. As it stands it kinda indicates that those errors could share some codes, but its not defined clearly which ones.

Yes, I know. You need to group those items in ,an array, in the JSON side, using the ,[, and ,], things to identify its start and end. Only then you can collect them in a ,List,.

Actually, I wasn't so sure how GSON operates internally and consequently did not quite understand how to use it.

The second solution was pretty much what I had in mind in the first place.. but I will have to replicate all the wanted methods manually. First solution seems 'unclean' for me.. lots of clutter and unwanted code.   	To Grodriguez, I have seen the use of ,IllegalStateException, in situations where the classes represent states in a model, where the methods are called through an interface reference, making its use a valid one.

I am a bit surprised by your first statement: in my experience doing numerical code is perfectly suited for Clojure but doesn't lend itself very well to an OO approach.

I also don't understand the need for mutable data for performance reasons. Maybe you can give as an example here?

I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.   	To keep it simple for the API developer you would have to provide a convenient way to create the concrete Services - either factory methods or a dedicated ServiceFactory.	XmlMapper	0	1	0	1	o

To Marcus: it may well be an internal app, but designing something with built-in limitations at this stage is a bad idea.  You may ,think, it will never need to scale, but can you be sure?  Save yourself the headache later down the line and adhere to some best practice!   	The only reason I can see for preventing the go() method in class A, B, and C from running concurrently is that they're sharing something.  If that's class data or database data, you should try to redesign so they share nothing.  That would allow them to run concurrently and not worry about interfering.  If that's not possible, then you should have one service that calls them in proper sequence to ensure that they can't be called out of order.  In either case, I think your design is flawed and the cure will be worse than the disease.  	C	0	0	0	0	n

Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption. (The reason being that a signature does not give the agent access to fhe id file conttainging the key pair.)  	decryption	0	1	0	0	o

Good answer. One suggestion for minor improvement: both GSON and Jackson also support use of JSON tree representation (for Jackson these are ,JsonNode,s, GSON has something similar). Might be good to show snippets, since that is similar to the only way org.json offers.   	Of listed features, nothing is unique compared to other options -- and claim of high-performance is not supported by anything; unlike for more mature libraries (Gson, Jackson, Genson, Boon) which are included in benchmarks like ,github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers,, ,github.com/novoj/JavaJsonPerformanceTest, or ,developer.com/lang/jscript , -- I have not seen this library included in tests, or mentions of it being widely used.

To Marcus: it may well be an internal app, but designing something with built-in limitations at this stage is a bad idea.  You may ,think, it will never need to scale, but can you be sure?  Save yourself the headache later down the line and adhere to some best practice!   	The only reason I can see for preventing the go() method in class A, B, and C from running concurrently is that they're sharing something.  If that's class data or database data, you should try to redesign so they share nothing.  That would allow them to run concurrently and not worry about interfering.  If that's not possible, then you should have one service that calls them in proper sequence to ensure that they can't be called out of order.

PUT and POST are meant for different things. Generally speaking if you want to create a NEW record in your service, then you use a POST.  However, if you have an existing record and you want to (UPDATE IT), meaning you need to retrieve it from the DB, Update, Save, then that is a PUT.   You can still use POST but the affect on the RAM/CPU is the same(if you use PUT/POST on this action)  I suggest you read ,rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2616#section-9.5, to get general information   	As others have already explained, the meaning of PUT and POST is different.

my main concern about adding spring security on top of my existing application is compatibility with the existing authentication system in place...or massive changes required to make it work.   	I'm not sure if i understand all the context of the problem. You have a legacy application which run on it's own authentication service, and you need to build a different service as a RESTful API and you need to authenticate both, right?  If that's the problem you could find a way to authenticate the RESTful web service, via your existing web application service. If you need to authenticate both, you could write an API who does the authentication and implement it in the web api and on the RESTful service.  	right	0	0	1	0	o

Your question is not very clear. I understand you're currently setting the parameters of your class API hard-coded in the code, and you want to have them as parameters instead. That's a good idea indeed. But how is this set actually done? Are you receiving this data from an API or from another method?   	Honestly, I don't really see any difference between the two approaches. In the current approach, they will have to write their input into ,api.add*, methods. In your approach, they will have to write their input into one ,String, (for the URL), a ,Map, (for the headers) and another ,String, (for the body), then call your function.

I'm accepting this answer because I mentioned I want it published as an enum and there is no other way of doing it. Although I went on a different path because I wanted to expose some of the additional functionality (but not all), and obviously it is undesirable to duplicate the additional functionality. Instead I exposed the enums as interfaces where the additional functionality that I want to publish are part of the interface, and enum constants are also listed as interface constants. This solution also avoids having to make conversions and implementation changes.   	The enum is used from multiple packages of the library, so I cannot reduce visibility. This implies the composition is also not a good solution (because it uses restricted access).  	enum	0	1	0	0	o
Have you tried logging the value of ,json,?   	Keep in mind this isn't a real problem.

OK, this was an answer looking for a question but I have tweaked it. Since writing this up, I have found that the github version 0.9.1 is not the latest.

In general it is an anti-pattern to store state or use a session as you are describing when implementing a REST API.  If possible, I recommend making you API stateless from the start it makes it much easier to scale later.  I'd use a DB and lookup the token based on the users JWT token info, or whatever you are using.  	info	0	1	0	0	o

I don't know if I've understood correctly, if not please provide some further explanation of your question.  What I got is that - You have some list with LatLng objects, and you are creating your markers basing on them. When the user clicks certain marker you want to know the position of the marker in creation order? Like if the user clicks the marker which has been created at first you want to get 0, 2nd ->1 3rd -> 2 etc ?   	"Integer on the map? I don't get it. And looking at your loop ""for (LatLng location : camerasLocations)"" your array contains only LatLng. Or maybe you are talking about this ""cameraList""? Please provide more information like what is ""j"". As I've written in my answer you can map markers with your objects from the list, that would be cleaner, better solution in my taste. Like Map<Marker, YourObject> and when the user clicks on a marker you can obtain related object and get it's name time etc.  "	LatLng	0	0	0	1	o

There are, but I would argue that you should understand the ideas underlying the widgets before you begin producing things with a widget library.

thanks. I guess it's a completely different way to consider the API. What about if it's not about accessing resources, but rather performing actions? (and not necessarily on a resource)   	REST is an architectural style for applications operating on resources. If your operations are not on resources (things identified via a web URL) then REST is not a appropriate style to use. You can perform actions either using HTTP methods as verbs, or by creating another resource which is the result of the action and navigating to that resource. As such a navigation is not side effect free, you should use POST rather than GET for the navigation.  	POST	0	1	0	0	o

For now I developed app that uses VLCJ and streams from 2 different cameras and desktop into 3 separate .flv files at the same time and it works. But I don't use out of process.. to be true, didn't heard about out of process player until yours answer on my question. I'll go now and read your article.   	I haven't yet tried using them, but if I am using JavaFX I'd prefer to wait until 2.0 came out and that horrible JavaFX script was deprecated. JavaFX on the desktop is possible with the current versions sure - but all the examples I've seen using video are rather hacky and usually depend on internals that might change from release to release.

Is the only difference that you call it API key instead of username or is there anything else?   	API keys in general are less secure than, say OAuth.  But they are simpler, which is part of the appeal.  Weather or not this trade-off is worth it depends on your needs and how your application is deployed.  My particular application was an internal application, not accepting connections from the outside world, so the trade-off was worth it in my case.  But I would not, for example, deploy an API key to a mobile application as the sole security mechanism because any user of the application will be able to get that API key.  	username	0	1	0	0	p
That example is wrong. Java does not have output parameters.   	In my opinion, this is a really ugly and bad way to return more than one result. Instead, create a (bean) class that contains the multiple things you need to return, and let the method return an instance of that. Slightly worse: Return an Object[] that contains the multiple things.  	Java	0	0	0	0	o

Why did you decide to use ,StreamingResponseBody, when you're not actually ,streaming, the response as you're building it? The point of ,StreamingResponseBody, is that it provides a callback method for you to implement, passing the ,OutputStream, to that method, so the method can write directly to the output stream as the response is generated. Your lambda expression ,outputStream -> streamService.getLocationData(), is not using the ,outputStream, parameter, so yu get no response data. What were you trying to accomplish by using ,StreamingResponseBody,?   	In order to actually stream, you need to send the ,outputStream, parameter into the ,getLocationData(), method, so it can render the next object into JSON and send it ,inside, the ,while, loop. This means that the code needs to invoke the JSON renderer itself, since if can no longer rely on the Spring framework to do it automatically. --- If you don't want to stream, don't use ,StreamingResponseBody,, and refactor the code so you only create one ,ResponseEntity,, not two, i.e. decide whether it is really the responsibility of ,getLocationData(), to create one.

After dealing with it a few times in code, I'm pretty sure it's that way just to make maintenance programmers angry at the API designer.  :-)  Greenfield programmers end up passing around LinkedList (instead of List) so they can use getLast().  Maintenance guys figure out that ArrayList is more appropriate and have to deal with all these specified LinkedLists that really should have been List in the first place (and probably would have been except for this one critical failure in the List interface)...   	To akarnokd Then you would have to change all your code, and make readers wonder why the custom list, all of that just for a ,getLast(), convenience.

Spring supports a basic level of aspect oriented programming (see Spring-AOP), so you could wrap an aspect that does the exception catching around your methods. Exception handling in Java is a classic use for AOP. But of course, this will not change the return type. So if your method does not declare that it returns something, your aspect will also not be able to return something suddenly. You can throw exceptions, of course.   	As Spring supports AOP( Aspect Oriented PRogramming) you can use logging aspect of it. It means at a given point cut you can put a message in your logs. Below is alink with more information about it.

Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class. I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.   	To RobertJohnson - the ,FizzService, knows it needs to return a ,Fizz,, but its parent ,AbstractService, only knows the ,invoke(...), is returning an Object. But ,AbstractService, is also the parent of ,WidgetService,, which returns ,Widget,s, and of ,BuzzService,, which returns ,Buzz,s, etc. The ,mappers, are the key here: how to inject the parent ,AbstractService, with the mappers, and to call ,the correct mapper methods from insider ,invoke,.

The only reason I can see for preventing the go() method in class A, B, and C from running concurrently is that they're sharing something.  If that's class data or database data, you should try to redesign so they share nothing.  That would allow them to run concurrently and not worry about interfering.  If that's not possible, then you should have one service that calls them in proper sequence to ensure that they can't be called out of order.

You seem to misunderstand what ,API, means. The API describes/defines the methods that can be called.

The example above is using normal SQL which is bad because it usually means that your app just became dependent on one specific SQL engine as opposed to being able to run on any DB back-end.

FYI... We provide classes like ,JsonSlurper, which simplify parsing data from JSON without necessarily having to map to a custom type like the ,Car, class mentioned above.

Why did you decide to use ,StreamingResponseBody, when you're not actually ,streaming, the response as you're building it?

You can publish the API in an interface and make all implementations package local, for instance. Also, this is not true that a Java source file requires a public class: your class can be package local. You can declare ,class XX {}, in XX.java. This means XX will only be accessible from the same pacakge.   	I second that; especially the 'extensibility' part, of course :) - However, it seems to me that many programmers fail to (fore-)see why and how users will want to extend their code - and a single method or field carelessly declared ,private, (or even lazily 'declared' package-private) can exclude a whole lot of useful extensibility.

Reading about MongoDb, it seems to me that because a mongodb query's input isn't really a command but rather a json filter, there's no concern about someone injecting malicious values. Everything is handled as data and not commands, hence no need for protection. Am I right?   	For complex queries, you'll find yourself creating a lot of objects for each query.  I do not feel safe re-using those.  Depending on which language / driver you're using, you can't really be sure of query-objects life cycle (or if they're thread safe).  	mongodb	0	0	0	0	o

Your question doesn't make sense.  You don't refresh an HTTP request.  Do you mean you want to make continual HTTP requests until you get a response?  That's probably a bad idea.

Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class. I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.   	"In your 'getFizzByBuzz' example you say in the comments that ""We asked API to send back a Fizz as JSON, so responseBody is a JSON String"". So why do you need to check the type of the response?

Mmph, I was asking more about how specifically you use the key in your youtube player.

That obviously might not be your problem, but it's hard to tell what's going on without seeing how you're using the key.   	Ahh. Okay. I've never done a direct youtube call from Android using the API, and to some extent I wonder if it's even possible. As far as I know, when it comes to using Youtube on Android, you've got two options. One (recommended!) you use the YoutubePlayer API, which is super easy to use, or two, you use the RTSP link, parse the JSON, and get a (usually really crappy quality) video. ,This, is a decent example of how to implement the former.

Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class. I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.   	To RobertJohnson - the ,FizzService, knows it needs to return a ,Fizz,, but its parent ,AbstractService, only knows the ,invoke(...), is returning an Object. But ,AbstractService, is also the parent of ,WidgetService,, which returns ,Widget,s, and of ,BuzzService,, which returns ,Buzz,s, etc. The ,mappers, are the key here: how to inject the parent ,AbstractService, with the mappers, and to call ,the correct mapper methods from insider ,invoke,.

IDENTITY means your database column is of type IDENTITY (any JPA doc would tell you this), and will be assigned on INSERT. When you persist a record post what is the SQL that is issued. This is the first step to understanding why you get that. aka debugging   	ohh ok thank you. I removed Id from the constructor and also added Column annotation for each field but still not working. Only thing I have not changed according to our suggestion is the strategy in the properties file. Mine work fine to fetch data from the table so I believe it is fine and not a matter of filed mapping. I went to the database and inserted records in the table and it does not expect a value for Id as it is automatically generated so it is really mind boggling why is this happening. I restarted my SQL server just in case and still no luck.	that	0	1	0	0	o

I think the problem is the use of GetKeyboardState: from MSDN, sounds like it's essentially equivalent to calling GetKeyState, whereas you want the equivalent for GetAsyncKeyState, since another thread has current input focus.

Note that this method just flags the document for encryption. Once it is flagged, encryption is automatic when you save with the current id file, and decryption is automatic when you open with it.  Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption. (The reason being that a signature does not give the agent access to fhe id file conttainging the key pair.)   	Ah, it's starting to come back to me... The documentation for this method is talking about using secret encryption keys, not public/private key pairs - but you can do it. I wrote an article about this many years ago.

I am a bit surprised by your first statement: in my experience doing numerical code is perfectly suited for Clojure but doesn't lend itself very well to an OO approach. As far as the performance goes: did you really measure the difference? Type hinting in Clojure will get you very close to Java performance. I also don't understand the need for mutable data for performance reasons. Maybe you can give as an example here?   	To Mauritz - yes I measured the difference! type hinting didn't get me quite close enough (boxing of primitives is the big killer, but there were also some other overheads I couldn't figure out - maybe I will revisit in Clojure 1.4 :-) ). I need mutability because I have to manipulate lots of temporary working data. a[i]=a[j]+x is very fast in Java, certainly at least an order of magnitude faster than updating any immutable data structure (which implies object allocation and gc overhead).

I had no idea these functions existed in ByteBuffer. I am going to have to play with them before being able to answer definitively. I always do the assembly manually (take the high byte and shift and add to the low byte). As a guess, make sure BIG_ENDIAN is correct for both input and output & that you are actually doing this correctly on the output end. That could account for what you are hearing, if LITTLE_ENDIAN is required for playback, or if the ByteBuf is defaulting LITTLE_ENDIAN on your putShort but needs to be BIG_ENDIAN.   	Thanks for the answer. I've tried with both LITTLE and BIG, if I put LITTLE I hear only noise, if I use the code as above (by default is BIG) I can perceive the sound, but with a lot of white noise above. So I think the endian is ok. Sorry I am very new with Java, I converted bytes to short for handle values in a easier way, but how would it be working with bytes directly?  	BIG	0	1	0	0	o

I don't understand your reasoning here; using constants for the property names wouldn't stop new properties being added. In any case, it's way easier and less risky to add a constant than to implement the feature that the constant represents, so I don't know why they wouldn't do both at the same time. For example, it's a lot less work to add one line defining the System.JAVA_IO_TMPDIR constant than to implement the feature whereby a JVM can know its own temporary directory.   	To Andrew. Not coupling to the host but to the properties keys them selves. Think about this, java.lang.System was among the first classes in Java. Back then they didn't quite knew what was going to be the platform like. It was aimed for TV sets, Futurist devices ( such as *7 ) among other things.

No, you don't hash client-side. Authentication is a solved problem, I urge you to look into auth services, like ,Auth0, perhaps.   	Is there a reason you want to hash the username and password at the app ? hashing is meant to protect the password at the server side. since you are passing username and password only the first time the user logs in  and from there on you use token or api upon successful authentication by the server . you don't need to worry about hashing the password at the client side. this will complicate things since the server has to know the hashing key of the client all the time.	username	0	1	0	0	o

The best would be to not reinvent your security framework. Which to use depends on what you want to secure, if you want to secure services there is no ,HandlerInterceptor, that will help you.

However as mentioned don't try to reinvent a security framework there are plenty out there use those instead. Generally they do more then just role/group based access.   	"To M.Deinum is basically right, but expressed technical detail in a way easy to misunderstand about AspectJ: ,Spring AOP, is based on dynamic proxies. ,AspectJ, however, about which the OP was talking (hint: modified class files) is not, no matter if used via compile-time weaving, as M. Deinum said, nor via load-time weaving, which is the usual way Spring users apply AspectJ and is described well in the Spring manual.

I am right or wrong.

As I wrote in my question, the direct way will be introduce synchronisation on particular entities's ids. This will simply prevent DB from being locked, so it will be no any hassles with timeout exceptions - sequentially executed DELETE methods will quickly return OK, as deleting of an absent entity in my API is legal operation.

Also is there any other method for Google transliteration without using Rhino   	The simplest way is to call their REST api directly, like in the example above.  Just set the ,ime, and ,text, parameters to your input (to select the languages and set the text to transliterate), make the call with HttpUrlConnection (or any other java HTTP client) and parse the JSON string it returns. I was half joking about the Rhino thing - it would work, but is a ridiculously complicated way of doing it.  	REST	0	1	0	0	o

Thanks for this. I would agree, it's important to maintain the consistency/integrity of data across endpoints. But (a) is more convenient imo, (e.g. when client is iterating through a list). What about going with (a) and including the quantityAvailable and priceForDates in all endpoints. quantityAvailable and priceForDates could be set to null when they aren't used or relevant. Or is this bad practice?   	I wouldn't do that. Not only I don't think it is easier for any client (iterating a list of (a) or (b) is equally simple, and (b) is better organized) but you must not add attributes to other endpoints that are not relevant in those cases just because you need them elsewhere. Option (b) is by far the best option.  	(b)	0	1	0	0	n

Why did you decide to use ,StreamingResponseBody, when you're not actually ,streaming, the response as you're building it?

API stands for ,a,pplication ,p,rogramming ,i,nterface, here is a good description: ,Wikipedia,. In general API is code that is used by other programmers to, for example, create a final product. It is kind of an utility tool. For example an API for mailing offers easy to use methods to setup and send mails, without having the full knowledge of mail protocols. So you could view the whole Java standard library as API, I would see ,library, as good synonym there.   	I would say an API consists of the whole set of classes and functions, together they form an API. But more precise the API is just the description of the input and output, it does not necessarily declare ,how, one must implement this description. This perfectly matches the concept of ,interface,s. So you could for example have someone that creates the API by just creating hundreds of ,interfaces, and their ,documentation,. Then another team could write implementations for example.  	library	0	1	0	0	o

My point is that ToUnicode should work out this shift information for you: but it needs accurate keyboard state information to work - it likely pulls the modifier information from that keyboard table, but since it's being fetched with GetKeyboardState, it does not necessarily reflect actual modifier state, which may be why it's returning unshifted characters.

Thanks To Jerrod Horton , you mean to say that every time url changes from v1/products to v2/products we have to change the client ??  and how should i do support both versioning v1 and v2 ? how google,youtube,facebook versioning api works?   	No problem.What I am saying is that if you use the url to version and you roll out a new version, your clients do NOT have to change (provided you are supporting your previous version).Because the url goes from /v1/products (which is being used and still supported) to /v2/products, that means that people using the /v1/products will be unaffected by the new version you introduce for /v2/products.

How could it be more secure to distribute all the data to every client?  A secure API that provides only the required data on demand seems much better.

Note that this method just flags the document for encryption. Once it is flagged, encryption is automatic when you save with the current id file, and decryption is automatic when you open with it.  Also note - the fact that you signed the agent with a given id is insufficient. It's the actual current id that counts, so if you sign it with ServerA, but run it on ServerB, it will be ServerB's public/private key pair that is used for encryption/decryption. (The reason being that a signature does not give the agent access to fhe id file conttainging the key pair.)   	Sorry, but I have not done any further investigations on this topic. I am not even sure that saving the document with an agent would work. But I think that the Domino back-end simply takes the Names-field for a Directory lookup to get the public key and encrypts the field with it.  	decryption	0	1	1	0	o

No need to go cross-context here. Just write a standard, classic portlet, e.g. an action- or resource handler and move the code there.

From that portlet you have all the portal/portlet context readily available and don't need to care getting everything you need. ,UserLocalServiceUtil, is also available.   	well, yes you can. The only thing is that - in the portal world - the URL is generated for you by the portal. It might look ugly. However, that shouldn't be anything to keep you from it: You can implement a redirect/url-rewrite in Apache, offering a pretty URL on Apache that is forwarded to an ugly portal URL. Or you can implement FriendlyURLs if you want to stay in the portal world. There are Liferay APIs for this.

API stands for ,a,pplication ,p,rogramming ,i,nterface, here is a good description: ,Wikipedia,. In general API is code that is used by other programmers to, for example, create a final product. It is kind of an utility tool. For example an API for mailing offers easy to use methods to setup and send mails, without having the full knowledge of mail protocols. So you could view the whole Java standard library as API, I would see ,library, as good synonym there.   	I would say an API consists of the whole set of classes and functions, together they form an API. But more precise the API is just the description of the input and output, it does not necessarily declare ,how, one must implement this description. This perfectly matches the concept of ,interface,s. So you could for example have someone that creates the API by just creating hundreds of ,interfaces, and their ,documentation,. Then another team could write implementations for example.  	API	0	1	0	1	o

Can you share your code where you persist the roles and users ?   	Yes, it is, using Entities in your Controllers as response or request should be avoided at all costs. See your entities as the core of your business. These are the classes you use in your services and while doing some serious business logic. All the other classes (so-called DTOs) are used to get data and send data to the consumers of your API. This also means that you decouple your public model from your domain model, meaning that you can change any of those without having to modify the other (of course the mapping needs to be changed, but that is hidden from the consumers of your API).

Option #1 is a reasonable option. Should I attempt to execute all the 4 operations non transactionally ?

Note that except for the queue operation, all tasks are idempotent because the DB tables and LDAP server will not accept duplicate entries.   	This depends on your application. If you need all the task to be done under one transaction then you need to rollback all changed to subsystems if any error occurs. In this scenario just make to rollback and throw Exception with the problem.

Thanks ! If I understand well my need (which is use the API to provision user to Workday from Okta) Hire_Employee would be the webservice I need. Because it's the first time I'm using Workay, I think it would be necessary that I fully understand how this solution works first.   	Provisioning between Okta and Workday normally works the other way.  I believe that Okta provide an integration which finds new employees in Workday and then creates them in Okta.  Going the other way is likely to require information that you may well not have in Okta.  If this is the case, then at best you are likely to need to make additional webservice calls to look up that information in Workday, at worst it may not be possible with capturing more data in Okta.

my main concern about adding spring security on top of my existing application is compatibility with the existing authentication system in place...or massive changes required to make it work.   	I'm not sure if i understand all the context of the problem. You have a legacy application which run on it's own authentication service, and you need to build a different service as a RESTful API and you need to authenticate both, right?  If that's the problem you could find a way to authenticate the RESTful web service, via your existing web application service. If you need to authenticate both, you could write an API who does the authentication and implement it in the web api and on the RESTful service.  	spring	0	0	1	0	n

Wouldn't it be possible to just inject a JsonMapper and a XmlMapper instance into the Service, that know how to convert the responseBody to a set Model class. I.e. change the static toSomething(body) methods to instance methods, and inject them the same way you inject the api builder when creating a Service. Maybe it would be benefitial to try and use Generics to enhance the type safety in the service classes -> something like ,FizzService extends AbstractService<Buzz, Fizz>, and using the type variables to restrict the injected api builder and mapper to the correct types.   	To Pyranja - same goes for your suggestions.

I doubt there is an universal answer to such a vague question. What kind of service are you offering? Does your API have an order in which actions should be processed? Do you want to simulate real use cases to find bottlenecks? Or do you suspect a specific endpoint to be a bottleneck and want to troubleshoot it?   	My api is connected to mongodb and hyperledger fabric network for anchoring transactions. The main goal is to find how much load this api can support, mainly how many tps. The main api endpoint works like this : the user posts some information, the api does some computation and then saves data in the database and calls the blockchain to anchor the data. Finally the api sends a response. The is that blockchain transaction verification takes time. Therefore another api endpoint sends the transactions status (validation time is required too).  	blockchain	0	0	0	0	o

"The Java part of a JNI Library is the same on every platform, but the native code part has to be compiled separately for every platform you support. If you look at how the ""loadLibrary()"" method works, you'll see that you only supply the root of the library name, and Java figures out what the file name should be on each individual platform.   "	Suggestion for working allot with JNI : use a IDE for C++ to create the native part, then use a IDE for Java / Android to test the wrapper. Don't make the mistake of using Eclipse /Net Beans / InteliJ for native... you would be better off with notepad++  and copiler. 2nd thing you need to take into account : When working on desktop, debug using a C++ wrapper equivalent to the java wrapper to test on desktop .

zeep allows you to call the web service methods with Python code and Python data to send to those methods. Zeep then marshals all of that into XML form and transforms your Python method call into a SOAP call to the web service. There is no Java class. There might be on the web service side if the service is written in Java, but you don't care about that as the client invoking  the service from Python. I asked for more details because your question doesn't really make sense in the way SOAP web services work.   	I'm sorry that I cannot and may not provide more information. I already use SoapUi and if I enter the parameters correctly here, the API sends the data correctly. So you are definitly right in assuming that I am passing data to zeep incorrectly.

So you want developers generate some HTML pages that contain reports?

JSP are not very lightweight to embed: I will need a jsp compiler and  don't feel the syntax will be a gain... Velocity or FreeMarker sounds better in this area.

I am a bit surprised by your first statement: in my experience doing numerical code is perfectly suited for Clojure but doesn't lend itself very well to an OO approach.

API stands for ,a,pplication ,p,rogramming ,i,nterface, here is a good description: ,Wikipedia,. In general API is code that is used by other programmers to, for example, create a final product. It is kind of an utility tool. For example an API for mailing offers easy to use methods to setup and send mails, without having the full knowledge of mail protocols. So you could view the whole Java standard library as API, I would see ,library, as good synonym there.   	I would say an API consists of the whole set of classes and functions, together they form an API. But more precise the API is just the description of the input and output, it does not necessarily declare ,how, one must implement this description. This perfectly matches the concept of ,interface,s. So you could for example have someone that creates the API by just creating hundreds of ,interfaces, and their ,documentation,. Then another team could write implementations for example.  	API	0	1	0	1	o

Good answer. One suggestion for minor improvement: both GSON and Jackson also support use of JSON tree representation (for Jackson these are ,JsonNode,s, GSON has something similar). Might be good to show snippets, since that is similar to the only way org.json offers.   	Of listed features, nothing is unique compared to other options -- and claim of high-performance is not supported by anything; unlike for more mature libraries (Gson, Jackson, Genson, Boon) which are included in benchmarks like ,github.com/eishay/jvm-serializers,, ,github.com/novoj/JavaJsonPerformanceTest, or ,developer.com/lang/jscript , -- I have not seen this library included in tests, or mentions of it being widely used.

Not totally positive what you're trying to do, but I would consider using the javax.validation package.  We use the ,hibernate implementation,.

How well this plays with maven dependencies, I also have other requirements where I need to make some database operations and doing that on JDBC would probably outweight the convenience of having the OSGI framework for supporting the runtime plugin architecture. Also, how well this standard compares to Apache Karaf?  Since In my understanding I could potentially use Karaf + JAX-RS for the REST endpoints.   	1) OSGi enRoute allows the addition of all maven dependencies through JPM. 2) Notice that OSGi is not an app server. You bring your own dependencies you do not have to depend on a limited set of standard services available. The enRoute REST is actually a POJO mapping to REST with JSON. This is a lot more OSGi and therefore easier to use than JAX-RS.  (And easy to port to JAX-RS if the need should arise one day.) 3) there is an OSGi spec for a REST API on an OSGi framework.	enRoute	0	1	0	0	o

The only reason I can see for preventing the go() method in class A, B, and C from running concurrently is that they're sharing something.  If that's class data or database data, you should try to redesign so they share nothing.  That would allow them to run concurrently and not worry about interfering.  If that's not possible, then you should have one service that calls them in proper sequence to ensure that they can't be called out of order.  In either case, I think your design is flawed and the cure will be worse than the disease.   	To overthink: What happens when he wants more service tiers?
