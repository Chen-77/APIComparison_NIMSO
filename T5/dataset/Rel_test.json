Others, you have to set them up at the OS level, and you have to make them a OS-level ,pre-condition, for your java app. Maybe I'm misunderstanding your problem, but it seems to me that at some point, your JVM deployment ,must, make some assumptions about what is being provided by the underlying OS. Good question though (+1 for you). sentence2:I sort of agree with you on this (that this is a OS-level task, not a JVM one.)

Well then thanks, that was much simpler than I thought :) sentence2:Just be careful about over-engineering this.  Clients use your library; events happen; there are data associated with those events.  All you need to do is define an interface that passes the client that event data and let them define the implementation they need.  Then allow the client to register for the event.  In that sense, @CodeLionX 's answer is a little more accurate for your situation.  IMHO, using a string to determine an action is not as clear as a specific interface method for that action.",

Most of the authentication that occurs for the application is via a user login. I suspect that it will be difficult to maintain and secure the existing REST services within the web app, hence the question.",
